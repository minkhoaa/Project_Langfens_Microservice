      "passage_md": "**Kormilda College**\n\n**Section A**\nKormilda College is a unique school situated near Darwin in Australia's Northern Territory. For 20 years, to 1989, Kormilda College operated as a government-run, live-in school for high school Aboriginal students. In 1989 it was bought from the Government by two Christian church groups and since then it has expanded enormously, to include a day school as well as boarders (residential students) in Years 8-12. Although 320 pupils of the College's total number are Aboriginal students, drawn mainly from isolated communities across the Northern Territory, Kormilda also has a waiting list of non–aboriginal students. With a current enrolment of 600, student numbers are expected to grow to 860 by 1999.\n\n**Section B**\nCentral to the mission of the school is the encouragement of individual excellence, which has resulted in programs designed especially for the student population. Specialist support programs allow traditional Aboriginal students, who are often second language users, to understand and succeed in the mainstream curriculum. A Gifted and Talented Program, including a special Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Tertiary Aspirations program, has been introduced, as has an Adaptive Education Unit. Moreover, in Years 11 and 12, students may choose to follow the standard Northern Territory Courses or those of the International Baccalaureate (I.B.).\n\n**Section C**\nTo provide appropriate pastoral care, as well as a suitable academic structure, three distinct sub-schools have been established:\n\n- **Pre-Secondary:** For Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students in Years 8-10 who are of secondary school age but have difficulties reading and writing.\n- **Supported Secondary:** For Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students who are of secondary school age and operating at secondary school year levels 8-12 who need specific second language literacy and numeracy support.\n- **Secondary:** For multi-cultural Years 8-12 students.\n\nStudents remain in their sub-schools for classes in the main subject areas of English, Maths, Social Education and Science. This arrangement takes into account both diverse levels of literacy and the styles of learning and cultural understandings appropriate to traditional Aboriginal second-language users.\n\n**Section D**\nTo aid the development of the Aboriginal Education program, a specialist curriculum Support Unit has been set up. One of its functions is to re-package school courses so that they can be taught in ways that suit the students. The education program offered to Aboriginal students uses an approach which begins with the students' own experiences and gradually builds bi-cultural understanding.\n\nAnother project of the Support Unit has been the publication of several books, the most popular, Kormilda Capers. Focusing on experiences which have directly affected the lives of students at the College, and on ideas and issues which are of immediate interest to Aboriginal students, Kormilda Capers has earned enthusiastic support within and outside the school."
