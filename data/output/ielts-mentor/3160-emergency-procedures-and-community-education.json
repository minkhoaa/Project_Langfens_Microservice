      "passage_md": "# Emergency Procedures\n\n**Revised July 2011**\n\nThis applies to all persons on the school campus.\n\nIn cases of emergency (e.g. fire), find the nearest teacher who will: send a messenger at full speed to the Office OR inform the Office via phone ext. 99.\n\n## PROCEDURE FOR EVACUATION\n\n1. Warning of an emergency evacuation will be marked by a number of short bell rings. (In the event of a power failure, this may be a hand-held bell or siren.)\n\n2. All class work will cease immediately.\n\n3. Students will leave their bags, books and other possessions where they are.\n\n4. Teachers will take the class rolls.\n\n5. Classes will vacate the premises using the nearest staircase. If these stairs are inaccessible, use the nearest alternative staircase. Do not use the lifts. Do not run.\n\n6. Each class, under the teacher's supervision, will move in a brisk, orderly fashion to the paved quadrangle area adjacent to the car park.\n\n7. All support staff will do the same.\n\n8. The Marshalling Supervisor, Ms Randall, will be wearing a red cap and she will be waiting there with the master timetable and staff list in her possession.\n\n9. Students assemble in the quad with their teacher at the time of evacuation. The teacher will do a head count and check the roll.\n\n10. Each teacher sends a student to the Supervisor to report whether all students have been accounted for. After checking, students will sit down (in the event of rain or wet pavement they may remain standing).\n\n11. The Supervisor will inform the Office when all staff and students have been accounted for.\n\n12. All students, teaching staff and support personnel remain in the evacuation area until the All Clear signal is given.\n\n13. The All Clear will be a long bell ring or three blasts on the siren.\n\n14. Students will return to class in an orderly manner under teacher guidance.\n\n15. In the event of an emergency occurring during lunch or breaks, students are to assemble in their home-room groups in the quad and await their home-room teacher.\n\n---\n\n# Community Education - SHORT COURSES: BUSINESS\n\n**Business Basics**\nGain foundation knowledge for employment in an accounts position with bookkeeping and business basics through to intermediate level; suitable for anyone requiring knowledge from the ground up.\n- Code: B/ED011\n- Date: 16th or 24th April, 9am–4pm\n- Cost: $420\n\n**Bookkeeping**\nThis course will provide students with a comprehensive understanding of bookkeeping and a great deal of hands-on experience.\n- Code: B/ED020\n- Date: 19th April, 9am–2.30pm (one session only so advance bookings essential)\n- Cost: $250\n\n**New Enterprise Module**\nUnderstand company structures, tax rates, deductions, employer obligations, profit and loss statements, GST and budgeting for tax.\n- Code: B/ED030\n- Date: 15th or 27th May, 6pm–9pm\n- Cost: $105\n\n**Social Networking – the Latest Marketing Tool**\nThis broad overview gives you the opportunity to analyse what web technologies are available and how they can benefit your organisation.\n- Code: B/ED033\n- Date: 1st or 8th or 15th June, 6pm–9pm\n- Cost: $95\n\n**Communication**\nTake the fear out of talking to large gatherings of people.
