For some time this popular resource slumped as the heavily trafficked internet job sites became widely regarded as offering greater numbers of employment opportunities. In many cases, this is a valid assumption. A local newspaper focuses on positions vacant in a specific town or region, whereas the online job site will typically contain advertisements for the whole country and possibly even overseas.\nIf you are seeking work in your neighborhood, and do not wish to drive a long distance or move, the local, classified ads in your newspaper may be a viable option. Recent canvassing has revealed that some local and regional employers don’t always post their position vacant ads on the major websites. Many prefer to advertise closer to home and to hire locally in order to avoid having to pay relocation costs.\nOften it is not necessary to purchase the newspapers, as these publications are widely available in libraries, coffee shops and even some waiting rooms. In addition, online newspaper editions, which contain the help-wanted ads, are now widely available and have contributed to the popularity of this form of advertising. These ads are usually searchable by date, category, keyword and location, making them competitive with the larger career and employment agencies found on the Internet.\nWhether you apply for a job through a large, on-line employment agency or via a classified ad in a newspaper the same strategy is valid. First of all, read the ad carefully and do your best to answer the following questions:\n•\nAm I the type of person the employer is looking for – do I have the essential skills and experience?\n•\nWith whom would I be working – a group of people, one person or would I work independently?\n•\nWhat other talents and experience can I include in my application?\n•\nWhat opportunities and experiences might be available in this position that would be advantageous to my career?\n•\nDo I have the skills to negotiate the challenges and problems of the position? (For example: working with much older employees or a woman working in an office full of men.)\nImportantly, try to find a way to stand out from the other applicants. Remember, whether you are responding to a positions vacant advertisement from an internet agency or a newspaper, your goal is to secure the interview before you stand a chance of being hired for the job.\nQuestions 21 - 27\nDo the following statements agree with the information given in the text?\nIn boxes\n21-27\non your answer sheet, write\nTRUE\nif the statement agrees with the information given in the text.\nFALSE\nif the statement contradicts the information in the text.\nNOT GIVEN\nif there is no information on this in the text. 22.\nOn-line job sites list more vacancies than job sites in newspapers. 24.\nTo avoid paying for moving expenses, employers advertise locally. 26.\nAn application should mention additional, relevant work experience.
