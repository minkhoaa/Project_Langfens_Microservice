Chiswick Polytechnic was closed at the same time West Thames College was opened. 16. The college changed its name to West Thames College in 1993. 18. Students under the age of 16 cannot attend any of the courses offered by the college. 20. There are fewer subjects to study in the sixth form of a school than at the college.\n\nWest Thames College (initially known as Hounslow Borough College) came into existence in 1976 following the merger of Isleworth Polytechnic with part of Chiswick Polytechnic. Both parent colleges, in various guises, enjoyed a long tradition of service to the community dating back to the 1890s. The college is located at London Road, Isleworth, on a site occupied by the Victorian house of the Pears family, Spring Grove House. An earlier house of the same name on this site had been the home of Sir Joseph Banks, the botanist who named Botany Bay with Captain Cook in 1770. Later he founded Kew Gardens. Situated at the heart of West London, West Thames College is ideally placed to serve the training and education needs of local industry and local people. But its influence reaches much further than the immediate locality. Under its former name, Hounslow Borough College, it had already established a regional, national and international reputation for excellence. In fact, about eight per cent of its students come from continental Europe and further afield, whilst a further 52 per cent are from outside the immediate area. Since 1 April 1993, when it became independent of the local authority and adopted its new title, West Thames College has continued to build on that first class reputation.\n\nThese days there is no such thing as a typical student. More than half of West Thames college's 6000 students are over 19 years old. Some of these will be attending college part-time under their employers' training schemes. Others will want to learn new skills purely out of interest, or out of a desire to improve their promotion chances, or they may want a change in career. The college is also very popular with 16-18 year olds, who see it as a practical alternative to a further two years at school. They want to study in the more adult atmosphere the college provides. They can choose from a far wider range of subjects than it would be practical for a sixth form to offer. If they want to go straight into employment they can still study at college to gain qualifications relevant to the job, either on a day-release basis or through Network or the Modern Apprenticeship Scheme.\n\nLook at the West Thames College's Services for Students on the following page. Each paragraph A-H describes a different service provided by the college.\n\ni. A shop for the books and stationery needed to study ii. Counseling and welfare willing to listen, offer advice or arrange a referral iii. An Examinations Office arranging exams and issuing certificates iv. A Registrar's Office handling all fee payments and related enquiries v. A Medical service offering on-site assistance with health-related problems vi. A tutorial system for regular one-to-one guidance, support and feedback vii. Careers Advice helping students into employment viii. An admissions Service providing assistance in choosing and applying for higher education courses ix. A Student Union representing students on college committees x. Clubs and societies for students' free-time xi. A Learning Support Service supporting students in studying, presenting information and handling numbers.\n\nA. As a full-time student at West Thames College, you will have your own Personal Mentor- who will see you each week to guide you through your studies, and discuss any problems which may arise. We take a cooperative approach to the assessment of your work and encourage you to contribute to discussion.\n\nB. This service provides specialist assistance and courses for those who need help to improve their writing, oral and numeracy skills for the successful completion of their college course. Help with basic skills is also available.\n\nC. This service is available to anyone who is undecided as to which course to follow. It is very much a service for the individual, whatever your age, helping you to select the best option to suit your circumstances. The service includes educational advice, guidance and support, including a facility for accrediting your previous experience - the Accreditation of Prior Learning (APL). The Admissions Office is open Monday to Friday 9.00 am to 5.00 pm. All interviews are confidential and conducted in a relaxed and friendly atmosphere. Evening appointments are available on request.\n\nD. The College Bookshop stocks a wide range of books, covering aspects of all courses, together with a good selection of stationery. It also supplies stamps, phone cards, blank videos and computer disks. The shop is open at times specified In the Student Handbook in the mornings, afternoons and evenings.\n\nE. When students are weary from study, and want the chance to relax and enjoy themselves with friends, they can participate in a number of recreational activities. Depending on demand, we offer a range of sporting activities including football, badminton, basketball, table tennis, volleyball, weight training and aerobics. For the non sporting students we offer a debating society, video club, hair and beauty sessions, as well as a range of creative activities. Suggestions for activities from students are always welcome.\n\nF. This confidential service is available if you have practical or personal difficulties during your course of study, whether of a financial or personal nature. Our Student Advisors can help you directly or put you in touch with someone else who can give you the help you need.\n\nH. West London employers have a permanent base in the centre of college, with access to a database of more than 24,000 jobs available locally and in Central London. They will also help you with job applications and interview techniques."
