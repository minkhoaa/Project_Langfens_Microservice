  "_raw_text": "GT Reading Test 13 Section 3 - Kormilda College\nDetails\nGT Reading Mock Test 13:\n|\nSection 1\n|\nSection 2\n|\nSection 3\n|\nSection 3: Questions 26-40\nYou should spend about\n20\nminutes on Questions\n26-40\nwhich are based on the text below.\nGT Reading:\nKormilda College\nRead the passage\n\"Kormilda College\"\nbelow and answer questions\n26-40\nthat follow.\nKormilda College\nSection A\nKormilda College is a unique school situated near Darwin in Australia’s Northern Territory. For 20 years, to 1989, Kormilda College operated as a government-run, live-in school for high school Aboriginal students. In 1989 it was bought from the Government by two Christian church groups and since then it has expanded enormously, to include a day school as well as boarders (residential students) in Years 8-12. Although 320 pupils of the College’s total number are Aboriginal students, drawn mainly from isolated communities across the Northern Territory, Kormilda also has a waiting list of non–aboriginal students. With a current enrolment of 600, student numbers are expected to grow to 860 by 1999.\nSection B\nCentral to the mission of the school is the encouragement of individual excellence, which has resulted in programs designed especially for the student population. Specialist support programs allow’ traditional Aboriginal students, who are often second language users, to understand and succeed in the mainstream curriculum. A Gifted and Talented Program, including a special Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Tertiary Aspirations program, has been introduced, as has an Adaptive Education Unit. Moreover, in Years 11 and 12, students may choose to follow the standard Northern Territory Courses or those of the International Baccalaureate (I.B.).\nSection C\nTo provide appropriate pastoral care, as well as a suitable academic structure, three distinct sub-schools have been established.\n◼\nPre-Secondary:\nFor Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students in Years 8-10 who are of secondary school age but have difficulties reading and writing.\n◼\nSupported Secondary:\nFor Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students who are of secondary school age and operating at secondary school year levels 8-12 who need specific second language literacy and numeracy support.\n◼\nSecondary:\nFor multi-cultural Years 8-12 students.\nStudents remain in their sub-schools for classes in the main subject areas of English, Maths, Social Education and Science. This arrangement takes into account both diverse levels of literacy and the styles of learning and cultural understandings appropriate to traditional Aboriginal second-language users. In elective subjects chosen by the students – which include Indonesian, Music, Art, Drama, Science for Life, Commerce, Geography, Modem History, Woodwork, Metal Work, Economics and Legal Studies – students mix on the basis of subject interest.\nSection D\nTo aid the development of the Aboriginal Education program, a specialist curriculum Support Unit has been set up. One of its functions is to re-package school courses so that they can be taught in ways that suit the students.\nThe education program offered to Aboriginal students uses an approach which begins with the students’ own experiences and gradually builds bi-cultural understanding. In one course, “Introducing Western European Culture Through Traditional Story-Telling”, students are helped to build a common base for approaching the English literature curriculum. Drawing on the oral culture of traditional Aboriginal communities, they are introduced to traditional stories of other cultures, both oral and written. In a foundational Year 10 course, “Theory of Learning”, concepts from Aboriginal culture are placed side by side with European concepts so that students can use their own knowledge base to help bridge the cultural divide.\nAnother project of the Support Unit has been the publication of several books, the most popular, Korniihla Capers. The idea for Kormilda Capers came about when it became obvious that there was a lack of engaging material for the school’s teenage readers. One of the stories in the book, “The Bulman Mob hits the Big Smoke”, recounts the adventures of Kormilda pupils on their first visit to Sydney, Canberra and the snow country. Focussing on experiences which have directly affected the lives of students at the College, and on ideas and issues which are of immediate interest to Aboriginal students, Kormilda Capers has earned enthusiastic support within and outside the school.\nQuestions 26 – 27\nComplete the following sentences with\nA NUMBER OR DATE\nfrom the passage.\nWrite your answers in boxes\n26-27\non your answer sheet.\n26.\nKormilda College opened as a school in\n..............................\n27.\nAt the time of writing there were\n..............................\nnon-aboriginal students at Kormilda College.\nQuestion 28\nFrom the list below, choose the best heading for Section B of the reading passage.\nWrite the appropriate letter\nA-D\nin box\n28\non pour answer sheet.\nA\nSpecialist teaching and teachers at Kormilda College\nB\nSpecial Programmes at Kormilda College for Aboriginal students\nC\nThe new look Kormilda College\nD\nProgrammes at Kormilda College to promote individual excellence\nQuestions 29 – 33\nThe following diagram shows how Kormilda College is organised.

<strong><em>&quot;Kormilda College&quot;</em></strong> below and answer questions <strong>26-40</strong> that follow.\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">\n\t<span style=\"color:#339966;\">Kormilda College</span></h2>\n<p>\n\t<span style=\"color:#006400;\"><strong>Section A</strong></span><br />\n\tKormilda College is a unique school situated near Darwin in Australia&rsquo;s Northern Territory. For 20 years, to 1989, Kormilda College operated as a government-run, live-in school for high school Aboriginal students. In 1989 it was bought from the Government by two Christian church groups and since then it has expanded enormously, to include a day school as well as boarders (residential students) in Years 8-12. Although 320 pupils of the College&rsquo;s total number are Aboriginal students, drawn mainly from isolated communities across the Northern Territory, Kormilda also has a waiting list of non&ndash;aboriginal students. With a current enrolment of 600, student numbers are expected to grow to 860 by 1999.<br />\n\t<br />\n\t<span style=\"color:#006400;\"><strong>Section B</strong></span><br />\n\tCentral to the mission of the school is the encouragement of individual excellence, which has resulted in programs designed especially for the student population. Specialist support programs allow&rsquo; traditional Aboriginal students, who are often second language users, to understand and succeed in the mainstream curriculum. A Gifted and Talented Program, including a special Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Tertiary Aspirations program, has been introduced, as has an Adaptive Education Unit. Moreover, in Years 11 and 12, students may choose to follow the standard Northern Territory Courses or those of the International Baccalaureate (I.B.).<br />\n\t<br />\n\t<span style=\"color:#006400;\"><strong>Section C</strong></span><br />\n\tTo provide appropriate pastoral care, as well as a suitable academic structure, three distinct sub-schools have been established.<br />\n\t<br />\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ◼&nbsp; <u>Pre-Secondary:</u> For Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students in Years 8-10 who are of secondary school age but have difficulties reading and writing.<br />\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ◼&nbsp; <u>Supported Secondary:</u> For Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students who are of secondary school age and operating at secondary school year levels 8-12 who need specific second language literacy and numeracy support.<br />\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ◼&nbsp; <u>Secondary:</u> For multi-cultural Years 8-12 students.<br />\n\t<br />\n\tStudents remain in their sub-schools for classes in the main subject areas of English, Maths, Social Education and Science. This arrangement takes into account both diverse levels of literacy and the styles of learning and cultural understandings appropriate to traditional Aboriginal second-language users. In elective subjects chosen by the students &ndash; which include Indonesian, Music, Art, Drama, Science for Life, Commerce, Geography, Modem History, Woodwork, Metal Work, Economics and Legal Studies &ndash; students mix on the basis of subject interest.<br />\n\t<br />\n\t<span style=\"color:#006400;\"><strong>Section D</strong></span><br />\n\tTo aid the development of the Aboriginal Education program, a specialist curriculum Support Unit has been set up. One of its functions is to re-package school courses so that they can be taught in ways that suit the students.<br />\n\t<br />\n\tThe education program offered to Aboriginal students uses an approach which begins with the students&rsquo; own experiences and gradually builds bi-cultural understanding. In one course, &ldquo;Introducing Western European Culture Through Traditional Story-Telling&rdquo;, students are helped to build a common base for approaching the English literature curriculum. Drawing on the oral culture of traditional Aboriginal communities, they are introduced to traditional stories of other cultures, both oral and written. In a foundational Year 10 course, &ldquo;Theory of Learning&rdquo;, concepts from Aboriginal culture are placed side by side with European concepts so that students can use their own knowledge base to help bridge the cultural divide.<br />\n\t<br />\n\tAnother project of the Support Unit has been the publication of several books, the most popular, Korniihla Capers. The idea for Kormilda Capers came about when it became obvious that there was a lack of engaging material for the school&rsquo;s teenage readers. One of the stories in the book, &ldquo;The Bulman Mob hits the Big Smoke&rdquo;, recounts the adventures of Kormilda pupils on their first visit to Sydney, Canberra and the snow country. Focussing on experiences which have directly affected the lives of students at the College, and on ideas and issues which are of immediate interest to Aboriginal students, Kormilda Capers has earned enthusiastic support within and outside the school.\n<h3>\n\tQuestions 26 &ndash; 27</h3>\n<p>\n\tComplete the following sentences with <strong>A NUMBER OR DATE</strong> from the passage.<br />\n\t<br />\n\tWrite your answers in boxes <strong>26-27</strong> on your answer sheet.<br />\n\t<br />\n\t<strong>26.</strong> Kormilda College opened as a school in <strong>..............................</strong><br />\n\t<strong>27.</strong> At the time of writing there were <strong>..............................</strong> non-aboriginal students at Kormilda College.<div style=\"margin:3px 0px 10px 0px;\"><script async src=\"https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-9958560017827154\"\n     crossorigin=\"anonymous\"></script>\n<ins class=\"adsbygoogle\"\n     style=\"display:block; text-align:center;\"\n     data-ad-layout=\"in-article\"\n     data-ad-format=\"fluid\"\n     data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-9958560017827154\"\n     data-ad-slot=\"1054007359\"></ins>\n<script>\n     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script></div>\n<h3>\n\tQuestion 28</h3>\n<p>\n\tFrom the list below, choose the best heading for Section B of the reading passage.\n<p>\n\tWrite the appropriate letter <strong>A-D</strong> in box <strong>28</strong> on pour answer sheet.<br />\n\t<br />\n\t<strong>&nbsp; A&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp; Specialist teaching and teachers at Kormilda College<br />\n\t<strong>&nbsp; B&nbsp; </strong>Special Programmes at Kormilda College for Aboriginal students<br />\n\t<strong>&nbsp; C&nbsp; </strong>The new look Kormilda College<br />\n\t<strong>&nbsp; D&nbsp; </strong>Programmes at Kormilda College to promote individual excellence\n<h3>\n\tQuestions 29 &ndash; 33</h3>\n<p>\n\tThe following diagram shows how Kormilda College is organised.
