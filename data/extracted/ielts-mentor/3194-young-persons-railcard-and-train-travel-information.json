      "text": "# The Young Person's Railcard & TRAIN TRAVEL INFORMATION\n\nA Young Person's Railcard gives young people the opportunity to purchase discounted rail tickets across Britain. Just imagine where it could take you - to festivals, to see distant friends or to London for a weekend break.\n\nWho can apply? Absolutely anybody between 16 and 25 can apply. You will need to provide proof that you are under 26 years of age. For this, only your birth certificate, driving licence, passport or medical card will be acceptable. Alternatively, if you are a mature student over this age but in full-time education, you can also apply. In order to prove your eligibility, you will need to get your headteacher, tutor, or head of department to sign the application form as well as one of your photos, the latter also needing to be officially stamped. 'Full-time education' is defined as over 15 hours per week for at least 20 weeks a year. Then go along to any major railway station, rail-appointed travel agent or authorised student travel office with your completed application form from this leaflet, together with £28, two passport-sized photos and proof of eligibility.\n\nUsing your railcard You can use it at any time - weekends, Bank Holidays or during the week. But if you travel before 10 am Monday to Friday (except during July and August) minimum fares will apply. For full details of these, please ask at your local station or contact a rail-appointed travel agent.\n\nConditions In cases where a railcard does not bear the user's signature, it will be treated as invalid. Neither your railcard nor any tickets bought with it may be used by anybody else. Unless there are no purchase facilities available at the station where you began your journey, you will be required to pay the full fare if you are unable to produce a valid ticket for inspection during a journey. Reduced rate tickets are not available for first-class travel or for Eurostar links to France and Belgium. Passengers will be charged the full rate if they want to use these services.\n\n1.

Alternatively, if you are a mature student over this age but in full-time education, you can also apply. In order to prove your eligibility, you will need to get your headteacher, tutor, or head of department to sign the application form as well as one of your photos, the latter also needing to be officially stamped. &#39;Full-time education&#39; is defined as over 15 hours per week for at least 20 weeks a year.<br />\n\t<br />\n\tThen go along to any major railway station, rail-appointed travel agent or authorised student travel office with your completed application form from this leaflet, together with &pound;28, two passport-sized photos and proof of eligibility.\n<p>\n\t<span style=\"color:#006400;\"><span style=\"font-size:14px;\"><strong>Using your railcard</strong></span></span><br />\n\tYou can use it at any time - weekends, Bank Holidays or during the week.
