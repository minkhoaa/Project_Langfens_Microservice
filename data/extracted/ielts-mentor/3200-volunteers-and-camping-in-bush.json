      "text": "# CAMPING IN THE BUSH\n\nVOLUNTEERS Thank you for volunteering to work one-on-one with some of the students at our school who need extra help. SMOKING POLICY Smoking is prohibited by law in the classrooms and anywhere on the school grounds. SAFETY AND HEALTH Volunteers are responsible for their own personal safety and should notify the school of any preexisting medical conditions. Prescription and any other medications that you normally carry with you must be handed into the school nurse on arrival and collected on departure. If you require them, the nurse will dispense them to you in her office. SIGN IN A signing book is located at office reception. Please sign this register every time you come to the school. This is important for insurance purposes and emergency situations. After signing the book, collect a Visitor’s badge from the office. This must be worn at all times when you are on school premises. Remember to return the badge afterwards. MESSAGES Teachers will communicate with volunteers via telephone, email or messages left at the office. Always ask for messages. You may communicate with teachers in the same way – the preferred method is to leave a memo in the relevant teacher’s pigeonhole. These can be found at the end of the corridor in the staffroom block. WORK HOURS We understand that your time commitment is entirely voluntary and therefore flexible. If your personal schedule should change and this affects your availability, please contact the Coordinator for Volunteers at the school on extension 402; alternatively, you could drop into her office situated in F block. ROLE OF THE COORDINATOR The Coordinator is responsible for matching volunteer tutors with students, organising tutorial rooms, ensuring student attendance and overseeing volunteer tutor training. If you encounter any problems, contact her as above.\n\nMINIMAL IMPACT BUSH WALKING Responsible campers observe minimal impact bush walking practices. This is a code of ethics and behaviour aimed at preserving the natural beauty of bush walking areas. PLANNING Good planning is the key to safe and successful camping trips. Obtaining a camping permit in advance of leaving to camp out overnight in a national park is obligatory. Bookings are also compulsory for some parks. There could be limits on group sizes in some parks. Occasionally campsites may be closed owing to bush-fire danger or for other reasons. Always obtain permission from the owner prior to crossing private property. EQUIPMENT As well as your usual bush walking gear, you will need the right equipment for camping. A fuel stove and fuel for cooking is essential: not only is it safer, faster and cleaner; but it is easier to use in wet weather. It is recommended that you pitch a freestanding tent which requires few pegs and therefore has less eco-logical impact. Take a sleeping mat, if you have one, to put your sleeping bag on for a more comfortable night’s sleep. You will also need a hand trowel to bury human waste – for proper sanitation and hygiene. CAMPFIRES The traditional campfire actually causes a huge amount of environmental damage. If you gather firewood, you are removing the vital habitat of insects, reptiles, birds and small mammals. When campfires lead to bush-fires, they create enormous danger to native bush inhabitants and bush-walkers alike and result in destruction of the environment. Under no circumstances should you light a fire in the bush. CAMPSITES Erect your tent at an existing site if possible; otherwise try to find a spot where you won’t damage vegetation. Never cut branches or move rocks or disturb the soil unnecessarily. Aim to leave your campsite as you found it or even cleaner. RUBBISH Remove all rubbish – carry it out with you. Don’t attempt to burn or bury rubbish because this creates a fire hazard and/or disturbs the soil. Animals can dig up buried rubbish and scatter it about. Never feed the local wildlife – carry out all food scraps as these disturb the natural nutrient balance and can create weed problems. WALK SAFELY Keep on the track. Wear footwear suitable for the terrain. Take a map.\n\nThe passage refers to three ways in which campers should behave. Classify the following behaviours as something that campers A must do B may do C must not do Write the correct letter A, B or C, in boxes 8–14 on your answer sheet. 8. get the landowner’s consent before walking across his land 9. Use a sleeping mat 10. Make a campfire in the bush 11. Feed the birds 12. Use a freestanding tent 13. Dig a hole to bury rubbish in 14. Get authorisation before setting out to camp in a national park"

  "_raw_text": "GT Reading Test 38 Section 1 - Volunteers & Camping in the bush\nDetails\nGT Reading Mock Test 38:\n|\nSection 1\n|\nSection 2\n|\nSection 3\n|\nSection 1: Questions 1-14\nRead the text below and answers questions\n1-14\non your answer sheet.\nYou should take around\n20 minutes\nto complete this task.\nGT Reading Sample -\n\"Volunteers\"\n&\n\"Camping in the bush\"\nRead the text below and answer\nQuestions 1–7\n.\nVOLUNTEERS\nThank you for volunteering to work one-on-one with some of the students at our school who need extra help.\nSMOKING POLICY\nSmoking is prohibited by law in the classrooms and anywhere on the school grounds.\nSAFETY AND HEALTH\nVolunteers are responsible for their own personal safety and should notify the school of any preexisting medical conditions. Prescription and any other medications that you normally carry with you must be handed into the school nurse on arrival and collected on departure. If you require them, the nurse will dispense them to you in her office.\nSIGN IN\nA signing book is located at office reception. Please sign this register every time you come to the school. This is important for insurance purposes and emergency situations. After signing the book, collect a Visitor’s badge from the office. This must be worn at all times when you are on school premises. Remember to return the badge afterwards.\nMESSAGES\nTeachers will communicate with volunteers via telephone, email or messages left at the office. Always ask for messages. You may communicate with teachers in the same way – the preferred method is to leave a memo in the relevant teacher’s pigeonhole. These can be found at the end of the corridor in the staffroom block.\nWORK HOURS\nWe understand that your time commitment is entirely voluntary and therefore flexible. If your personal schedule should change and this affects your availability, please contact the Coordinator for Volunteers at the school on extension 402; alternatively, you could drop into her office situated in F block.\nROLE OF THE COORDINATOR\nThe Coordinator is responsible for matching volunteer tutors with students, organising tutorial rooms, ensuring student attendance and overseeing volunteer tutor training. If you encounter any problems, contact her as above.\nQuestions 1–7\nDo the following statements agree with the information given in the text above?\nIn boxes\n1–7\non your answer sheet, write:\nTRUE\n- if the statement agrees with the information\nFALSE\n- if the statement contradicts the information\nNOT GIVEN\n- if there is no information on this\n1.\nAs a volunteer, you will be helping students individually.\n2.\nYou may smoke in the playground.\n3.\nYou cannot take any medicine while at the school.\n4.\nIf you forget to sign the register, you won’t be insured for accidents.\n5.\nThe best way of communicating with teachers is in writing.\n6.\nYou can choose your own hours of work.\n7.\nThe coordinator keeps student attendance rolls.\nRead the text below and answer\nQuestions 8–14\n.\nCAMPING IN THE BUSH\nMINIMAL IMPACT\nBUSH WALKING\nResponsible campers observe minimal impact bush walking practices. This is a code of ethics and behaviour aimed at preserving the natural beauty of bush walking areas.\nPLANNING\nGood planning is the key to safe and successful camping trips. Obtaining a camping permit in advance of leaving to camp out overnight in a national park is obligatory. Bookings are also compulsory for some parks. There could be limits on group sizes in some parks. Occasionally campsites may be closed owing to bush-fire danger or for other reasons. Always obtain permission from the owner prior to crossing private property.\nEQUIPMENT\nAs well as your usual bush walking gear, you will need the right equipment for camping. A fuel stove and fuel for cooking is essential: not only is it safer, faster and cleaner; but it is easier to use in wet weather. It is recommended that you pitch a freestanding tent which requires few pegs and therefore has less eco-logical impact. Take a sleeping mat, if you have one, to put your sleeping bag on for a more comfortable night’s sleep. You will also need a hand trowel to bury human waste – for proper sanitation and hygiene.\nCAMPFIRES\nThe traditional campfire actually causes a huge amount of environmental damage. If you gather firewood, you are removing the vital habitat of insects, reptiles, birds and small mammals. When campfires lead to bush-fires, they create enormous danger to native bush inhabitants and bush-walkers alike and result in destruction of the environment. Under no circumstances should you light a fire in the bush.\nCAMPSITES\nErect your tent at an existing site if possible; otherwise try to find a spot where you won’t damage vegetation. Never cut branches or move rocks or disturb the soil unnecessarily. Aim to leave your campsite as you found it or even cleaner.\nRUBBISH\nRemove all rubbish – carry it out with you. Don’t attempt to burn or bury rubbish because this creates a fire hazard and/or disturbs the soil. Animals can dig up buried rubbish and scatter it about. Never feed the local wildlife – carry out all food scraps as these disturb the natural nutrient balance and can create weed problems.\nWALK SAFELY\nKeep on the track. Wear footwear suitable for the terrain. Take a map.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nQuestions 8–14\nThe passage refers to three ways in which campers should behave.\nClassify the following behaviours as something that campers\nA must do\nB may do\nC must not do\nWrite the correct letter\nA, B\nor\nC\n, in boxes\n8–14\non your answer sheet.\n8.\nget the landowner’s consent before walking across his land\n9.\nUse a sleeping mat\n10.\nMake a campfire in the bush\n11.\nFeed the birds\n12.\nUse a freestanding tent\n13.\nDig a hole to bury rubbish in\n14.\nGet authorisation before setting out to camp in a national park\nAnswer:\nShow/ Hide Answers\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n\nGT Reading\nPrev\nNext",

/>\n\t<strong><span style=\"font-size:14px;\">SAFETY AND HEALTH</span></strong><br />\n\tVolunteers are responsible for their own personal safety and should notify the school of any preexisting medical conditions. Prescription and any other medications that you normally carry with you must be handed into the school nurse on arrival and collected on departure. If you require them, the nurse will dispense them to you in her office.<br />\n\t<br />\n\t<strong><span style=\"font-size:14px;\">SIGN IN</span></strong><br />\n\tA signing book is located at office reception. Please sign this register every time you come to the school. This is important for insurance purposes and emergency situations. After signing the book, collect a Visitor&rsquo;s badge from the office. This must be worn at all times when you are on school premises. Remember to return the badge afterwards.<br />\n\t<br />\n\t<strong><span style=\"font-size:14px;\">MESSAGES</span></strong><br />\n\tTeachers will communicate with volunteers via telephone, email or messages left at the office. Always ask for messages. You may communicate with teachers in the same way &ndash; the preferred method is to leave a memo in the relevant teacher&rsquo;s pigeonhole. These can be found at the end of the corridor in the staffroom block.<br />\n\t<br />\n\t<strong><span style=\"font-size:14px;\">WORK HOURS</span></strong><br />\n\tWe understand that your time commitment is entirely voluntary and therefore flexible. If your personal schedule should change and this affects your availability, please contact the Coordinator for Volunteers at the school on extension 402; alternatively, you could drop into her office situated in F block.<br />\n\t<br />\n\t<strong><span style=\"font-size:14px;\">ROLE OF THE COORDINATOR</span></strong><br />\n\tThe Coordinator is responsible for matching volunteer tutors with students, organising tutorial rooms, ensuring student attendance and overseeing volunteer tutor training.

This is a code of ethics and behaviour aimed at preserving the natural beauty of bush walking areas.<br />\n\t<br />\n\t<strong>PLANNING</strong><br />\n\tGood planning is the key to safe and successful camping trips. Obtaining a camping permit in advance of leaving to camp out overnight in a national park is obligatory. Bookings are also compulsory for some parks. There could be limits on group sizes in some parks. Occasionally campsites may be closed owing to bush-fire danger or for other reasons. Always obtain permission from the owner prior to crossing private property.<br />\n\t<br />\n\t<strong>EQUIPMENT</strong><br />\n\tAs well as your usual bush walking gear, you will need the right equipment for camping. A fuel stove and fuel for cooking is essential: not only is it safer, faster and cleaner; but it is easier to use in wet weather. It is recommended that you pitch a freestanding tent which requires few pegs and therefore has less eco-logical impact. Take a sleeping mat, if you have one, to put your sleeping bag on for a more comfortable night&rsquo;s sleep. You will also need a hand trowel to bury human waste &ndash; for proper sanitation and hygiene.<br />\n\t<br />\n\t<strong>CAMPFIRES</strong><br />\n\tThe traditional campfire actually causes a huge amount of environmental damage. If you gather firewood, you are removing the vital habitat of insects, reptiles, birds and small mammals. When campfires lead to bush-fires, they create enormous danger to native bush inhabitants and bush-walkers alike and result in destruction of the environment. Under no circumstances should you light a fire in the bush.<br />\n\t<br />\n\t<strong>CAMPSITES</strong><br />\n\tErect your tent at an existing site if possible; otherwise try to find a spot where you won&rsquo;t damage vegetation. Never cut branches or move rocks or disturb the soil unnecessarily. Aim to leave your campsite as you found it or even cleaner.<br />\n\t<br />\n\t<strong>RUBBISH</strong><br />\n\tRemove all rubbish &ndash; carry it out with you. Don&rsquo;t attempt to burn or bury rubbish because this creates a fire hazard and/or disturbs the soil. Animals can dig up buried rubbish and scatter it about. Never feed the local wildlife &ndash; carry out all food scraps as these disturb the natural nutrient balance and can create weed problems.<br />\n\t<br />\n\t<strong>WALK SAFELY</strong><br />\n\tKeep on the track. Wear footwear suitable for the terrain. Take a map.\n<p>\n\t---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<h4>\n\tQuestions 8&ndash;14</h4>\n<p>\n\tThe passage refers to three ways in which campers should behave.<br />\n\t<br />\n\tClassify the following behaviours as something that campers<br />\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />\n\t<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A must do<br

<strong>8&ndash;14</strong> on your answer sheet.</em><br />\n\t<br />\n\t<strong>8.</strong> get the landowner&rsquo;s consent before walking across his land<br />\n\t<strong>9. </strong>Use a
