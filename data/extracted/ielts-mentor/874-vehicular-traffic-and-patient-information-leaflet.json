      "text": "# USE OF UNIVERSITY GROUNDS BY VEHICULAR TRAFFIC\n\n1. University employees do not need to pay for their parking permits. 2. Parking in Halls of Residence is handled by the Wardens of the Halls. 3. Having a University permit does not allow staff to park at Halls. 4. Parking permits cost £20 a year. 5. Students living in Hall do not need permission to park in Hall car parks.\n\nThe University grounds are private. The University authorities only allow authorised members of the University, visitors and drivers of vehicles servicing the University to enter the grounds. Members of staff who have paid the requisite fee and display the appropriate permit may bring a vehicle into the grounds. A University permit does not entitle them to park in Hall car parks, however, unless authorised by the Warden of the Hall concerned. Students may not bring vehicles into the grounds during the working day unless they have been given special permission by the Security Officer and have paid for and are displaying an appropriate entry permit. Students living in Halls of Residence must obtain permission from the Warden to keep a motor vehicle at their residence. Students are reminded that if they park a motor vehicle on University premises without a valid permit, they will be fined £20.\n\nExample Answer Borodine table should not be given to ...... A and M\n\nA. children under 12 years of age. B. a headache. C. an uncomfortable feeling in your stomach. D. symptoms similar to a cold. E. a change in your skin colour. F. anything treated by a prescription medicine. G. a kidney complaint. H. a whitening of the eyes. I. sore or broken skin. J. a fungal infection. K. a feeling of sadness. L. shortness of breath. M. a woman expecting a child.\n\nIn some circumstances, it is very important not to take Borodine tablets. If you ignore these instructions, this medicine could affect your heart rhythm.\n\nOther side-effects are dizziness or headaches, and indigestion or stomach ache. However, these effects are often mild and usually wear off after a few days' treatment. If they last for more than a few days, tell your doctor."
