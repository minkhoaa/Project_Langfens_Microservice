FIRST AID FOR SNAKE BITES
Snakes are not normally aggressive and tend to bite only when they are threatened or mishandled. Some snakes, e.g. the carpet snake, are not poisonous. Others, e.g. the brown snake, tiger snake and taipan, are very poisonous.
A      Prevention
◻ leave snakes alone and do not collect snakes
◻ do not put your hands in hollow logs, under piles of wood, or in rubbish
◻ be noisy when walking in the bush
◻ look carefully when walking through thick grass
◻
use a torch around camps at night
B      Symptoms and signs
These do not appear immediately, but from about 15 minutes to 2 hours after the casualty is bitten. There are often no visible symptoms or signs. Take seriously any information from a casualty concerning:
◻ strong emotional reaction
◻ headache or double vision
◻ drowsiness, giddiness or faintness
◻ nausea and/or vomiting and diarrhoea
◻ puncture marks about 1 centimetre apart at the site of the bite. Bites are usually on the limbs, especially the legs.
◻ breddening
◻ bruising
◻ sweating
◻ breathing difficulties
C       Management
◻ reassure the casualty
◻ apply a pressure immobilisation bandage over the bitten area and around the limb
◻ seek medical aid urgently
D      Snakebite Warnings
◻ never wash the venom off the skin as this will help in later identification
◻ never cut or squeeze the bitten area
◻ never try to suck the venom out of the wound
