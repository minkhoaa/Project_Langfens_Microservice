SYDNEY TRAVEL COLLEGE
At this College, we recommend the Multiplan policy.
Travel insurance requirements
As this course includes a total of three months' travel outside Australia, travel insurance is compulsory. If you are sick or have an accident in Australia, your medical bills will be fully covered - however, you cannot assume that everything will be covered overseas, so please read the following requirements carefully.
1. Medical
Australia has reciprocal medical arrangements with the governments of the eight nations you will be visiting. This arrangement will cover all emergency hospital   treatment. However, students will have to take out insurance such as Multiplan to cover the costs of all visits to doctors, and other non-emergency medical situations.
If you have a serious accident or illness, Multiplan insurance will cover the cost of your flight back to Australia, if required. Depending on the circumstances, this may also pay for either medical personnel or a family member to accompany you home. Multiplan insurance may not cover all pre-existing medical conditions - so before you leave be sure to check with them about any long-term illnesses or disabilities that you have.
If you do require medical treatment overseas, and you want to make a claim on your insurance, the claim will not be accepted unless you produce both your student card and your travel insurance card.
2. Belongings
The Multiplan policy covers most student requirements. In particular, it provides students with luggage insurance. This covers any loss or theft of your everyday belongings. For example, this insurance covers:
•  the present value of items that are stolen, provided that you  have purchase receipts for every item; if no receipts, no payment can be made
•  replacement value of your briefcase or backpack and study books
•  portable computers and CD players, if you specifically list them as items in the policy
3. Cancellation
This insurance covers any non-refundable deposit and other costs you have paid if you have to cancel due to 'unforeseen or unforeseeable circumstances outside your control'. It does not provide cover if you change your study or travel plans for other reasons.
