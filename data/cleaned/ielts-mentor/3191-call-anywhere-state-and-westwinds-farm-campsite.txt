CALL ANYWHERE IN THE STATE FOR ONE LOW SHORT-DISTANCE RATE!
You have a choice of three Superfine Mobile Digital access plans: Leisure time, Executive and Highflier. They are designed to meet the needs of light, moderate and high-volume users. Calls in each plan are charged at only two rates - short-distance and long-distance.
You enjoy big savings with off-peak calls.
LEISURETIME
:
Your mobile phone is mainly for personal use. You use your phone to keep family and friends in touch. You - don't want to strain your budget.
With this plan, you enjoy the lowest monthly access fee and extremely competitive costs for calls. However, a monthly minimum call charge applies.
EXECUTIVE:
You're in business and need to be able to call your office and your clients whenever the need arises. You value the convenience of a mobile phone but need to keep a close eye on overheads.
For frequent users: the monthly access fee is slightly higher, but you enjoy the savings of a discounted call rate.
HIGHFLIER:
You are always on the move and communications are critical. You need to be able to call and be called wherever you are -- world-wide.
As a high-volume user, you pay an access fee of just $60 a month but even lower call rates.
Peak Time:
7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Monday-Saturday.
Off-peak:
all other times, including all day Sunday. Billing increments are in 30-second unit. Call charges are rounded up to the nearest cent. In off-peak periods, calls are subject to a minimum charge of two 30-second units.
Once-Only Connection Fee:
$30 plus additional $35 for your SmartCard.
