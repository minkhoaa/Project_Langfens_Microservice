USE OF UNIVERSITY GROUNDS BY VEHICULAR TRAFFIC
The University grounds are private.
The University authorities only allow authorised members of the University, visitors and drivers of vehicles servicing the University to enter the grounds.
Members of staff who have paid the requisite fee and display the appropriate permit may bring a vehicle into the grounds. A University permit does not entitle them to park in Hall car parks, however, unless authorised by the Warden of the Hall concerned.
Students may not bring vehicles into the grounds during the working day unless they have been given special permission by the Security Officer and have paid for and are displaying an appropriate entry permit. Students living in Halls of Residence must obtain permission from the Warden to keep a motor vehicle at their residence.
Students are reminded that if they park a motor vehicle on University premises without a valid permit, they will be fined £20.
