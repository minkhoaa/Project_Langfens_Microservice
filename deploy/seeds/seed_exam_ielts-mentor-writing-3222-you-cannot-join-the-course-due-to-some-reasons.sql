  E'["Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI am excited to be accepted into the \\"Advertising and Public Relations\\" course at your college in the summer semester. However, I regret to inform you that I will not be able to join the course as I was denied a visa from the embassy.\\nLast March, I applied for a full-time four-year Bachelor of Arts course in “Advertising and Public Relations” and got the acceptance letter on 12th April. I initially planned to enrol in the course from the beginning of June, but unfortunately, my visa application with the UK embassy was rejected. They are yet to send me details for the refusal, but I thought I should inform you without delay as someone else should get the chance. I guess I will have to wait for the next semester to start the course.\\nI would like to request you to consider me for the next semester. In case this is not possible, I would like to know the procedure to apply again to the same course.\\nI am looking forward to hearing from you at your convenience.\\nYours faithfully,\\nRohit Kumar", "Dear Sir or Madam,\\nIt is quite a privilege for me to have been granted admission at your renowned college, but unfortunately, I will not be able to enrol in the course because of some unavoidable reasons. However, I am expecting to enrol in this same course at a favourable time, if you allow me to do so.\\nDuring the last fall semester, I applied for a 2-years Master''s degree in Business Administration and got accepted immediately as the classes were to start from mid-September. I have always wanted to study Business Administration because I wanted to be a business administration and management personnel from my early high school years. Due to this, I have completed my Bachelor''s degree in Business Administration. So, I was naturally quite excited to have an admission to your college. Then, suddenly, after getting the admission letter from your college, I got an offer of a paid internship from a very prestigious bank in my country to work as a Management Trainee.\\nAnd, since it was a great opportunity for me to gain some valuable experience in the field of Management, I immediately decided to accept the offer. But, I would still like to study at your college in the same course if you consider me for the next semester. Kindly tell me about the procedure.\\nYours faithfully,\\nPeter Joshua\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 4.64 (11 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nGT Writing Task 1\\nFormal Letter\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\n×\\nReport\\nReport\\nClose"]'::jsonb,
