  E'["Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI visited your restaurant on 11th May with my family to celebrate my sister’s birthday. We usually enjoy your food but this time it was utterly disappointing. I am hoping that you will keep your food quality intact and take action regarding the bad dining experience we have had.\\nWe have always considered your restaurant as the most classy French cuisine place in town. Since my sister lives in France, we dine at your restaurant every time she is in our country. This time it was even more special as we were celebrating her birthday. But the whole event was ruined due to the dishes we were served.\\nI suppose you can imagine our disappointment when we found the onion soup absolutely inedible. It was cold, and it appeared your chef did not stir it well while cooking. Some clogs of flour were visible in the soup. Moreover, the main course was cold and not up to our expectations. They tasted very ordinary and hackneyed but we paid almost thrice for these items! We asked a waitress about the reasons and she had no plausible excuse for that.\\nI am looking forward to hearing that you have taken the necessary steps to maintain your reputation and food quality. Otherwise, you have already lost a customer.\\nYours faithfully,\\nElizabeth Harley", "Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI am a regular diner at your restaurant on Madison Avenue. Today, I am writing to express my discontent with the meal that I and my family had at your restaurant last Thursday. I am hoping that you will take the necessary action to improve your food quality and maintain your reputation.\\nRecently, I have been promoted to the Senior Internal Auditor in my office, and to celebrate this event, I took my family out to your restaurant on Madison Avenue. We ordered four servings of shrimp fried rice, but we were shocked to discover that the shrimp in our serving was undercooked and had a pungent odour. After complaining about it to the supervisor, we were told that the restaurant had run out of shrimp - not a valid excuse for a distinguished restaurant like yours. You can understand my frustration when my family and I had to leave the restaurant empty stomach and with utter disappointment.\\nMy intention in writing this letter is to ask you to issue a \\"show cause notice\\" to the supervisor at your restaurant, and disseminate instructions to all your staff to hold a modicum of buffer stock for every item, just in case the restaurant runs out of that item and so that no customer experiences a humiliation.\\nYours faithfully,\\nMuhammad Sameed\\n[", "Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI am Leslie Aston, writing to express my disappointment with my recent dining experience at your restaurant. My family and I visited your establishment last Saturday evening to celebrate a special occasion, but unfortunately, our experience fell short of expectations. I am hoping that you will take proper action regarding this.\\nUpon arrival, we were greeted warmly by your staff and seated promptly. However, the problems began when we received our meals. The food was served cold and lacked the freshness and flavour we had anticipated. Additionally, several items were missing from our order, which further detracted from our dining experience.\\nAs a loyal patron of your restaurant, I believe it is important to bring these issues to your attention. I understand that mistakes can happen, but the quality of our meal was unacceptable given the reputation of your establishment.\\nIn light of these issues, I kindly request that you take appropriate action to address the shortcomings we experienced during our visit. This may include reviewing your kitchen procedures, ensuring proper food handling and preparation, and providing additional staff training to prevent similar incidents in the future.\\nI trust that you will take our feedback seriously and make the necessary improvements to maintain the high standards that your restaurant is known for. Thank you for your attention to this matter.\\nYours faithfully,\\nLeslie Aston", "Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI am Rona Lyn Olivar, a regular customer of your Cozy Place Restaurant, and today I am writing to complain about the unpalatable meals and desserts we were served last Sunday. I am hoping that you will maintain your food standard and probe into the event that ruined our evening.\\nI, along with my husband and children, went to your restaurant at around 7:00 o''clock on 27th July to celebrate my husband''s job promotion. It was supposed to be a happy and memorable night because we were commemorating a special event as a family in one of our favourite restaurants. But we have had a frustrating experience.\\nWe ordered lamb steak, spuds and toasted sandwiches as our main course, but the steak was salty, raw and hard. On top of that, our sandwiches were served cold! Though we complained about our food to the waitress, she did not mind us and instead told us to complain to the manager. This was quite unexpected and unprofessional.\\nI demand a full refund that I paid for the meal and your steps towards making your staff behaviour more professional and cordial. Otherwise, consider me as a lost customer.\\nI look forward to your immediate response regarding this.\\nYours faithfully,\\nRona Lyn Olivar", "Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI am a regular customer of your restaurant “The Bay Leaf\\" and visited the place with my wife to celebrate our 1st marriage anniversary on 10th February.

But, last night it was a big disappointment. I had my table booked well in advance but it was allocated to someone else, which is not acceptable as it hurts customers'' faith in your service.\\nMoreover, the meal was less than average. The first course of sea trout was tasteless and salty. We mentioned that the duck was undercooked but no comment or apology was made at the time. To add more grief, my wife''s duck had a large piece of gristle in it which was a shame. Besides, our steward was not very effusive or communicative, and he appeared to be going through the motions as quickly as possible.\\nI am a regular customer of your restaurant and if this is what you are going to continue in future, then I will have to find a different place for family occasions.

I was there with my whole family to celebrate my son''s birthday. It was a happy day which turned into disappointing due to the bad food and service we got from your restaurant.I booked my table 14 for thirteen people two days prior to the occasion and in fact, received the confirmation through an email. When we visited your restaurant on my son''s birthday, no table was available for us and a staff member told us to wait for about 10 minutes which in fact, turned to 25 minutes! Secondly, the food we ordered was not served in the right quantity and at the top of it, the food items were bit cold. When we asked one of your employees to take it back and fetch us a fresh one, we were puzzled by the unprofessional behaviour of your staff. Therefore, I would like to notify you about this situation which literally ruined our celebration. Your restaurant is always the favourite place for my family to celebrate all our special occasions, but I guess this is not the case anymore. I expect you to take immediate action and educate your staff to provide good customer service and train them how to handle customer concerns with care.

So far it was our favourite restaurant and we frequently went there for taking our meals or to celebrate any special occasion. But it was quite a shocking experience for me to celebrate my wife''s birthday party at your restaurant.

After waiting for more than 45 minutes, a waiter served the food. However, the quality of service and food arrangement were awful. We ordered special curry with mutton but they provided us hard and cold mutton. Besides the quality of fried rice was not up to the mark. We felt very much annoyed. At last, we told your staff to give us coffee but the waiter could not serve that because of the unavailability of the coffee.

Your restaurant is the one stop place for most of our familial celebrations. It is very close to my house and the hospitality offered by your staff is incredible.Unfortunately, the party we organised on the 1st August turned into a chaos. We booked the family hall for 25 people a week ago, which was confirmed with Mr Pat, Assitant In charge. When we were about to begin the event, another family came to our venue claiming that they had booked the venue. We had to leave the place because of the unorganised booking.After that, we decided to continue the event at our home with a great frustration. We had to convince every of our invited guests that it was a mistake and some of them left the venue due to their disappointment. But a bigger frustration came when we unboxed the birthday cake. The cake seemed so weird and the shape of Hello Kitty that was assured to us was not made.In this regard, I would like you to take a prompt action regarding the careless booking system. This happened due to the negligence of one of your staff members and would like the assurance from your side for the better management of the special events like this.

I am Jyoti and a local inhabitant of the town.Last Friday I, along with my sisters, went to your restaurant to have our lunch. After we did our shopping, we felt hungry. We noticed your restaurant and thought to experience a fabulous lunch as we heard so much about your restaurant. But our experience in your restaurant was very disappointing.Initially we ordered mo:mo as we are very fond of it. Next, we ordered chow mein. The waiter told us that food would arrive in next 15 minutes. But we waited for nearly 45 minutes and no food appeared in front of us. Suddenly a waiter brought mo:mo. But when we tasted it, it tasted like the stale food of few days! We could not eat it. We complained it to the waiter. He told us to complain it to the manager. It was quite unprofessional and embarrassing. When chow mein arrived, we thought it would be tasty which would fulfil our appetite. But when we started eating, we found that it was too much salty and oily. We stopped eating it. After some hot debates with your waiter, we paid for the food we ordered. I want to inform you that your restaurant is located near a very popular mall. If you improve your food quality you can attract many costumers and enhance your reputation. But if you provide these types of service, your restaurant will get a bad reputation and would be forced to get out of the business. So you should change your chef and employ experienced and cordial staff. I hope you will put our request into action.Yours FaithfullyJyoti .\\nReply\\nQuote\\nManoj\\n9 years 4 months\\nHi, I have a doubt in this line from Model 1:I will appreciate you if you could have taken an action about this inconvenience.My Doubt is - could have taken VS could takeThis event is not yet happened, you are telling the manager to do something based on your letter.

I am Keshav Grover, visited your restaurant with my family last Friday on a special occasion- my mother''s birthday, to rejoice the evening with them. We ordered the Thai-soup & some appetisers and the main course from the menu. First of all, the waiter took more than an hour to serve the order. Moreover, the food ingredients were in a stale condition and were not properly cooked!

The food and the service ruined our celebration. you can understand our frustration when I and my family left the restaurant with an empty stomach.

Unfortunately, the things that we requested in accordance to the party were not followed. First, we have given the exact number of guests who would be present in the party but to my surprise, not enough tables and chairs were available at that time and that was quite embarrassing for me and my family. Second, the dish that we chose was altered slightly without even informing us.Third, we chose the entertainment package while we booked but neither the gaming facility nor any music was present on that day. We were told that there was a staff scarcity to accommodate us any additional entertainment.I was really disappointed with the services that your restaurant and staff have offered.

I am writing you to express my displeasure with the food and service that I received on that day. First of all, my family ordered the signature meal ‘The Curry Fish Head’. I specifically told the waiter to serve us the nonspicy one which he acknowledged. When the dish arrived, I was surprised that he served us the spicy dish!

Surprisingly, he just told us that your restaurant does not serve the nonspicy Curry Fish Head and he left us acting like he was so busy.Secondly, when I demanded to speak to the manager, the waiter told me that he was occupied and he would relay the message to the manager.

My wife and I visited your Bistro to celebrate our 2nd marriage anniversary and we were accompanied by some of our friends and family members. Your restaurant was highly recommended by my best friend and recently I liked the way you advertised your service on TV.We intended to order five different menus - pasta, pizza, roasted chicken, caesar salad and special ham. Apparently, we waited for 40 minutes before someone arrived to take our order. I assume your staff members did that only from negligence. I was so disappointed when I had to keep my guests waiting for more than an hour before the menu arrived and frustratingly they were all cold. Moreover, the taste of foods was not really convincing as what you advertise on TV. Truly an upsetting issue for all of us.I recommend that you look in to this issue and make the price more reasonable. Also, work on the menu to improve the quality by adding more ingredients or by replacing your chef. I do hope this problem will be addressed promptly by you to keep your business reputation.Yours faithfully,Jeff rey G Quinones.\\nReply\\nQuote\\nAbhi\\n9 years 9 months\\nDear Manager,I am writing this letter to inform you about the bad experience we had at your restaurant last night.Being a regular customer, I have frequented your restaurant for almost 5 years with my family and friends. I have recommended your restaurant to many of my colleagues and friends because of the great food and service your team provides to us. But last night''s service and the quality of food were just opposite to our expectation. We ordered some starters and soups in the beginning which came after we waited for 45 minutes and that too was cold & not properly cooked. You can imagine the frustration we had at that time after receiving it after such a long time. We decided not to order further for the main course as we were not able to swallow that cold soup and starters. Adding to that when we complained this to one of your staff members we got very annoying and unprofessional response that they forgot to serve the food because of such a huge crowd on eve of Ester and challenged us to go ahead with complaint to the manager. It is quite an irresponsible and unprofessional behaviour of your staffs and the quality of food being served as against the reputation of your restaurant have in the market. Please take this complaint seriously and act against the staff who were responsible for yesterday''s serviceThanking You Abhi.\\nReply\\nQuote\\nMuhammad Ali\\n9 years 9 months\\nDear Sir/MadamMy name is Muhammad Ali and I am writing with the regards to my frustration from a recent visit to your restaurant. On March 09, 2017, I visited your restaurant with my wife. I went to your restaurant based on one of my best friends’ recommendation. He shared a very positive review of your restaurant, foods, and services and therefore, I decided to celebrate my wife’s birthday there. But to my surprise, the decision was a terrible one!We ordered the corn soup, chicken biryani, chicken curry and bread. First of all, the waiter took more than an hour to serve the food even though there were a few other customers at that moment. Initially, he told us it will take only 15 minutes but he kept us waiting for more than an hour without any explanation. Second, the soup was cold and foods were not properly cooked. Third, we ordered chicken curry but your stuff served us mutton curry which was quite furious.I will appreciate if you try to understand my dissatisfaction and take proper action about the inconvenience which we had to experience in a special event. If you continue with your current chefs, then this restaurant’s reputation will go down pretty soon. Also, try to train your waiters about manners and professional behaviours. Yours faithfullyMuham mad Ali.\\nReply\\nQuote\\nKrupa\\n9 years 11 months\\nDear Sir, I am writing this letter to complain about the low-quality food that we were served in your restaurant last Sunday. I am Krupa, visited your restaurant with my family as we decided to celebrate my mother''s birthday. We are regular diners at your restaurant; hence we decided to order tomato soup with cream, but to our surprise, we found that the soup was not hot enough and bread crumbs were also missing! this is quite surprising! We complained to the waiter to replace the soup. We found that he again brought the same soup bowls and we were very disappointed by the service. Moreover the main course served was also very oily and my child had a severe stomach pain after we went home. I demand the full refund of the money for the food we ordered and for the inconvenience caused. I look forward for the immediate response against this. Yours SincerelyKrupa.\\nReply\\nQuote\\nLoad more comments\\n57\\n×\\nReport\\nReport\\nClose"]'::jsonb,
