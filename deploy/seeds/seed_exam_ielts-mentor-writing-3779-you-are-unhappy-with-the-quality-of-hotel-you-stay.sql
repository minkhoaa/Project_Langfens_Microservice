  E'["Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI understand that no business likes to hear these kinds of things from their customers, but sometimes, we just can not help but complain about the poor or bad service.\\nI am not too happy about the hotel that you booked for me recently. The name of the Hotel was “Concordia Hotel”, located in the city of Lisbon, and I was supposed to stay there from 5th to 9th June, to enjoy my new year’s holiday that was arranged by you.\\nUnfortunately, I had to check out of the hotel after spending only two nights there because of some unpleasant experience. First of all, I did not find the hotel rooms to be clean enough for the prices I paid. It had a bad odour that made me irritated as long as I stayed there. Moreover, the hotel did not offer me any free shuttle service anywhere in the city even though that is exactly what I was told.\\nI did not get the services that I was promised by your travel agency. So, it is only fair that I get a full refund of the money that I paid for the hotel charges.\\nI hope to hear from you soon regarding this.\\nYours faithfully,\\nFreddy Noble\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 3.13 (26 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nGT Writing Task 1\\nFormal Letter\\nComplaints-letter\\nLetter Writing Sample\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\n×\\nReport\\nReport\\nClose"]'::jsonb,
