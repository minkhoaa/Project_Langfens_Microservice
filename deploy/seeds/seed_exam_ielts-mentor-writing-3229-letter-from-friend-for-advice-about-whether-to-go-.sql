  E'Letter From Friend For Advice About Whether To Go To College',
  E'You should spend about\n20\nminutes on this task.\nYou recently received a letter from a friend asking for advice about whether to go to college or to try to get a job. You think he/she should get a job.\nWrite a letter to this friend.\nIn your letter:\nsay why he/she would not enjoy going to college\nexplain why getting a job is a good idea for him/her\nsuggest types of job that would be suitable for him/her\nWrite at least\n150\nwords.\nYou do\nNOT\nneed to write any addresses.\nBegin your letter as follows:\nDear ...................,\nSample Answer 1:\nDear James,\nHope you''re doing great, and thank you for writing to me. You''ve asked for my advice regarding the next step you should take - either to join a college or get a job. I''d like to suggest that you should gain some work experience before pursuing higher education.\nAs I personally know you, you''d not enjoy going to college right now because you''ve always wanted to work and what better time can it be to work than now? I personally feel that getting a job is a better idea for you as it would expose you to the real business world which you can capitalise in your education since you''re interested in studying Business Administration.\nI joined university just after finishing high school and consequently, I couldn’t get any job experience in my field which I often regret. I believe you should not make the same mistake, and instead take the opportunity to gain some valuable skills such as delegating tasks, managing time, meeting deadlines and working in a team. The job experience will enhance your decision-making and presentation skills. Moreover, it''ll open doors for better job opportunities in the future.\nI feel you should work in a large retail shop as a salesperson or perhaps join a small company that serves customers directly. It makes sense as it would be easier for you to find such a job in your city and it would let you understand the business frame closely.\nI hope my suggestion would help you decide what is best for you.\nWarm regards,\nJeffrey',

  E'["Dear James,\\nHope you''re doing great, and thank you for writing to me. You''ve asked for my advice regarding the next step you should take - either to join a college or get a job.

In your letter, you asked for my advice on your next course of action, and I wanted to share my thoughts on your dilemma about whether to go to college or start working. As I know you very closely, I genuinely believe that getting a job would be the best option for you.\\nIn relation to college life, I feel that you may not enjoy it as much as you expect. From our conversations, I know that you prefer hands-on experience rather than sitting in lectures all day. Studying for exams and writing long research papers might not be your cup of tea at the time, and I worry that you may find it frustrating rather than fulfilling.\\nOn the other hand, starting a job right away could be a great way to gain real-world experience, develop new skills, and become financially independent. You''ve always been practical and eager to learn through doing, so working would allow you to progress faster in your career.\\nGiven your strong communication skills and creativity, I think a role in marketing, sales, or event management would suit you perfectly.\\nLet me know what you decide - I’d love to hear your thoughts!\\nWarm wishes,\\nEmma", "Dear David,\\nI''ve received your letter, and I''m so glad that you all are doing fine. Also, I thank you for taking me into confidence in order to consult about a decision as important as either getting a job or going to a college.\\nWhile I consider both propositions to be very crucial for personal and professional growth, I think that timing and personal circumstances are also important when taking such an important decision. And, knowing you personally for quite some time, I don’t think that timing and circumstances are exactly on your side as far as the issue of going to a college is concerned. In fact, I know, how you don’t like doing so much homework and love to explore new places and opportunities. So, I''d suggest that you should gain some job experience before you start college.\\nYou should get a job as a front desk agent at a hotel because I know you have an outgoing personality, and you like to meet and talk to different kinds of people. After all, a hotel is a place which is visited by all kinds of new people almost every day. I wish you the very best of luck.\\nWarm wishes,\\nAntony\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 3.93 (21 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nGT Writing Task 1\\nInformal Letter\\nletter to a friend\\nLetter Writing Sample\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\nAslbek\\n1 year 2 months\\nDear Behruz,\\nI hope I read your letter in time. As far as I know, You are currently studying at the University of Economics. You should study very hard these days and always work on yourself. Because your parents, relatives and most importantly your motherland have high expectations from you.\\nAs I know you, thank you so much for asking me about getting a job or going to college. I think you should learn a lot of important ideas and useful experiences for yourself right now. If you want to earn more, you need to know at least 2 or 3 languages and you will not have trouble finding a job in the future.\\nAs I read this letter, you are going to Harvard University next year for a master''s degree and a part-time job. So I liked your idea. Nowadays they offer good salaries to students Who go to study in foreign countries. Hopefully, you get a good job and get a good salary. Therefore you should not stop trying and you will definitely achieve your goals.\\nIf you need help, don''t hesitate to ask me for advice.\\nWarm wishes,\\nAslbek\\nReply\\nQuote\\nSaravanan\\n5 years 8 months\\nDear Brian,\\nIt''s really great to receive a letter from you yesterday. I am delighted that you and Jenna are doing well. We''d plan for a family\\nget-together very soon.\\nBy the way, I understand that you are in a dilemma whether to fulfil your ambitions on getting a Master degree from Oxford University or to get a job. Knowing about the current economic crisis which we are undergoing and keeping in mind that Jenna is currently\\nunemployed, I suggest that you must find a new job soon. That way, it''d help you to become financially stable.\\nI have already forwarded your profile to my company''s hiring team to get you a suitable role. I am sure these awful times would be over soon. There are a plethora of options that can be planned in the future to fulfil your desire for higher education which we can discuss when we meet in person.\\nAwaiting for your response.
