  E'["Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI am writing this letter in response to a letter that I received from your bank a few days ago. In the letter, it was indicated that $240 was overdrawn from my account and that is why I will be charged $70. However, I think this is a mistake from one of your employees or the computing system.\\nAs you know, I am staying in a rented house, and my rent goes directly to the landlord''s account from my account with your bank. Last month, I changed my house and wrote a letter to you requesting not to vest the money anymore to the previous owner''s account. I have got the acknowledgement from you of my application. Perhaps, this money is overdrawn from my account because one of your employees incorrectly sent the money to my former owner.\\nHowever, I will request my earlier house owner so that he returns the money. I expect you will give immediate attention to this matter.\\nI look forward to receiving your response.\\nYours faithfully,\\nJohn Davis", "Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI am writing in reply to a letter which I received from your bank a few days ago. In your letter, you state that I am $240 overdrawn and that you will be charging me $70. This information is inaccurate and I am hoping that you would rectify it sharply.\\nI would like to point out that the reason I am overdrawn is because of a mistake made by your bank. If you look through the records of my account you will notice that I wrote to your bank several weeks ago explaining the situation. For the last twelve months, I have been paying $300 a month for a car I bought last summer. The monthly payments were taken directly from my bank account. However, two months ago I sold the car and I wrote to you instructing you to stop paying the monthly instalments. I received a letter from you acknowledging my request, but, for some reason, nothing was done about it. Another $300 instalment has been paid this month and this is the reason why I am overdrawn.\\nI would like you to contact the showroom where I bought the car to explain your error. I would also like you to ask them to return the money.\\nYours faithfully,\\nEmily Jones", "Dear Sir  or Madam,\\nI am writing this letter in connection with a letter that I received from your bank two days ago. In the letter, you stated that I am $240 overdrawn and due to this, I will be charged $70 which would be deducted from my savings account. I can assure you that I have not overdrawn any amount and it must be a mistake from the bank''s end which you must scrutinise before imposing on me the overdrawn charge.\\nAs you know, for the last eleven months, I have been paying a $300 monthly instalment for a car loan that I took from your bank. The monthly instalments are taken directly from my savings account. However, last month I paid the outstanding amount of the loan and settled it with the bank. I even wrote to the bank instructing that I have fully paid my car loan. I received a letter from you acknowledging my request, but, for some reason, nothing was done about it. Another $300 instalment has been paid to the loan this month and this is the reason I am shown overdrawn in my statement. I am attaching the statement with this letter.\\nNo doubt this is a mistake you should correct immediately. I would like you to reverse the transaction and stop the monthly instalment payment from my savings account as the loan amount has already been settled.\\nThank you for giving the matter your attention and I hope to hear your reply soon.\\nYours faithfully,\\nSandra Roll", "Dear Sir  or Madam,\\nI am writing in response to a letter (Ref.: PB-25478 R/TA as of 19th November 2025) that I received from the Bank that stated that I would be charged $70 from my account, in lieu of an overdrawn amount of $240 made on 15th March 2025. Please note that I have not overdrawn from my saving account and thus should not be charged any fee.\\nOn 15th March 2025, I made a purchase of $480 from the 7Eleven supermarket. During the checkout, the shopkeeper accidentally swiped the debit card twice but realising his mistake, has immediately reversed the transaction and confirmed that the reversal would be done successfully in 3 business days. I later received an SMS regarding the reversal on 19th March. However, according to the statement, I was charged the same amount twice on that day, which is a mistake.\\nTherefore, I would request you not to charge me $70 for the overdraft that I did not do. It is indeed a mistake and your bank should have already rectified it.\\nThank you for giving this your attention and I hope to hear from you soon.\\nYours faithfully,\\nRiya Nagpal\\n[", "Dear Sir  or Madam,\\nI am writing this letter in response to a letter that I received from the City Bank yesterday. The letter stated that $240 was overdrawn from my account and I will be charged $70 due to this. However, I think this mistake from the bank''s end as I have not overdrawn any amount.\\nMy monthly house rent till October was $400 and it went directly to the house owner’s account from my checking account. Last month I left the house and moved into my own apartment. Besides, I instructed the bank not to vest the money anymore to the owner’s account. According to my statement, last month''s rent, which is equivalent to $400, was debited from my account. This should not have happened and I should not be responsible for the mistake.\\nI hope you would take steps to reverse the transaction and do not charge me any fee for a mistake made by one of your employees. However, I will request my previous landlord so that he returns the money.\\nI expect you will give immediate attention to this matter. I look forward to receiving your response.\\nYours faithfully,\\nLumen Khan\\n[", "Dear Sir  or Madam,\\nI am writing in response to a letter that I received from your bank a few days ago. The letter stated that I am $240 overdrawn and that you will be charging me $70 due to this. I request you to verify the information before imposing the charge.\\nI would like to point out that the reason I am overdrawn is because of a mistake made by your bank. If you analyse the recond you will notice that I wrote several weeks ago explaining the situation. For the last twelve months, I have been paying $300 a month for a car I bought. The monthly payments were taken directly from my bank account. However, two months ago I sold the car and I wrote to you instructing you to stop paying the monthly instalments.

Please, explain your error and ask them to return the money.\\nYours faithfully,\\nHarold Acton", "Dear Sir  or Madam,\\nI am writing this letter to notify you of a mistake in my transaction record which was forwarded to me yesterday from the bank. Perhaps the mistake was made by one of your employees and I am hoping you would rectify it.\\nThe letter that I received outlined that I overdrew $240 last month and that is why I will be charged $70 which would be deducted directly from my account. I really am very worried about this because I have not overdrawn any amount from my bank account during the last six months. I visited your bank on 25th March to deposit $500 and I withdrew $240 a week later. There is a possibility that my $500 deposit was not correctly entered in your accounting tally book. I am attaching my deposit slip of $500 with this letter.\\nI request you to correct this error and do not charge me any penalty. Such an error in a customer''s account is not expected from a reputed bank like yours. Therefore, I also suggest you scrutinise the transaction history of a customer before sending him a letter.\\nThank you for giving the matter your attention\\nYours faithfully,\\nSudip Pant\\n[", "Dear Sir  or Madam,\\nI am writing to notify you that I have recently received a letter from your bank which outlines that my account is $240 overdrawn and I will be charged $70, deductible from my account, which I insist is not accurate.\\nI withdrew some money from my account (A/C. No.: 5132483720) three weeks ago and that was the last debit transaction that I made. Afterwards, I visited the bank once to deposit money into the same account. As I can see, the withdrawn amount of 540 dollars on 24th April is inaccurate and it shows that I withdrew the money using my debit card. I, however, do not use any debit card and always do my transactions using bank cheques.\\nKnowing that I have received incorrect information, I request you to take appropriate actions so that the problem is sorted out and corrected in due time. I hereby present a copy of my bank book and receipts for further information and proof.\\nYours faithfully,\\nGeleta Jabeessa\\n["]'::jsonb,
