  E'["Dear Mrs Linda,\\nI am writing this letter to give you some updates on the farewell party for Elizabeth Gomez, which you asked me to arrange.\\nThe party is supposed to be arranged at one of the most beautiful and spacious convention centres in our city, known as The Blue Paradise, located across the downtown, which is only a few miles away from our office. Our party can start between 3 to 5 pm and should not continue after 11:30 pm. We also have fixed a tentative date for the party between the 5th of May and the 9th of May.\\nThere certainly will be some delicious food items and drinks at the party. I know the eating habits of most of our co-workers well, and they all prefer European cuisines that are made of vegetables and seafood. Besides, we could also have some options for entertainment, such as, “sing all you can” where anybody can sing his or her favourite song, and share some of our fun memories at work. Finally, we will give some gifts to our departing colleague.\\nThat is all that I can share with you now. But if you feel that we need to add something else here or bring some corrections, please feel free to share.\\nYours sincerely,\\nJoseph Crowley\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 3.63 (12 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nGT Writing Task 1\\nLetter to office manager\\nLetter Writing Sample\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\nZeinab\\n3 months 24 days\\nDear Mr Smith,\\nI hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. I have just learnt that John will soon be leaving our company, and I was truly saddened by the news. Nevertheless, regarding your request, I would be more than happy to organise a farewell party for him, as he is one of my closest friends.\\nTo begin with, we need to set a date and time that suits all our colleagues. Since many of them have a demanding role and find it difficult to spare time during the weekdays, I strongly believe the weekend would be more convenient. In particular, I suggest Saturday evening at eight o’clock. This would allow everyone to enjoy the event and still have enough rest afterwards.\\nAs for the venue, I recommend the new restaurant directly across from our office that serves Indian cuisine. John is especially fond of spicy food, and I am sure he would be delighted. After the meal, we could enjoy some French Champagne and perhaps a short Indian dance performance. The restaurant is spacious enough to accommodate all these activities comfortably.\\nI am confident that John will appreciate this arrangement and have a memorable farewell party. I will be glad to make all the arrangements within 24 hours of your confirmation.\\nThank you for your support, and I look forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience.\\nYours sincerely,\\nZeinab Doroudian\\nReply\\nQuote\\nHari B Thapa\\n2 years 3 months\\nDear Mrs. Maya,\\nI am writing to discuss the arrangements for our colleague''s farewell party, as you have requested. It is important to make this event memorable and enjoyable for our departing colleague, and I have some suggestions to ensure that.\\nFirstly, I recommend holding the farewell party on a Friday evening, preferably two weeks from now. This schedule would allow most of the team members to attend without conflicting with their work commitments. Starting the event at 6:30 p.m. would give everyone enough time to wrap up their work for the week and join the celebration.\\nIn terms of the venue, I suggest reserving a private area at a local restaurant with a pleasant ambience. This way, we can have a comfortable and relaxed atmosphere for the gathering. I have already looked into a few options, and I can provide you with a list to choose from.\\nRegarding food and entertainment, I propose organizing a buffet-style dinner with a variety of options to cater to different preferences. Additionally, we could have a slideshow of memorable moments and a few heartfelt speeches to express our appreciation for our colleague''s contributions.\\nPlease let me know your thoughts on these suggestions, and I will proceed with the planning accordingly. Thank you for entrusting me with this responsibility, and I look forward to making our colleague''s farewell a special and memorable occasion.\\nSincerely,\\nHari B Thapa\\nReply\\nQuote\\n×\\nReport\\nReport\\nClose"]'::jsonb,
