  E'["Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI am writing to register a complaint with you regarding poor service, and the rude attitude by your staff that I experienced last Monday when I visited your shop. I am hoping you would take proper steps so that no other customer feels humiliated the way I did.\\nI went to your shop on Monday, 24th November, with the intention of purchasing a microwave oven for my home. While I was in your shop, not a single employee approached and offered me any assistance! They were watching a soap opera on the television and were fully focused on the show. I decided to ask one of the employees for help but he showed no interest to help me. He was actually rude when I asked him what type of microwave ovens were available in the shop and if he could assist me. He pointed out his finger to another employee and this gesture was extremely awkward. I was not there to ask a favour, rather, to purchase a product and the unprofessional employees you have are surely going to cost your business.\\nI regret to have been in your shop and will never be there. However, you should know how poorly your staff treats your customers. I am hoping you would take the proper initiative to offer a better customer experience in the future by hiring more professional employees.\\nYours faithfully,\\nIrene Byers", "Dear Sir or Madam,\\nRecently I went to your office to inquire about the air conditioner repair services that you offer at residential homes. But your staff members were not professional at all, to say the least.\\nOne of my air conditioners had not been functioning properly for the last couple of days. So, it was an emergency situation for me to get my AC fixed as soon as possible to survive in this terribly hot weather. But, when I visited your office last week, I was kept waiting for a long time just to talk to someone. On top of that, when I was finally able to talk to one of your experts, he did not seem to be too interested in listening to my problems. To tell you the truth, I didn’t expect such disturbing behaviour from a company like yours, especially, when I drove about 45 minutes to arrive at your office.\\nAnyway, I did not lodge a complaint, but I felt offended by such behaviour. Therefore, I would highly appreciate it if you get all of your AC repair experts to value all of your visiting customers and solve their problems like true professionals.\\nYours faithfully,\\nRabid Menon\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 4.28 (20 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nGT Writing Task 1\\nFormal Letter\\nComplaints-letter\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\nSiva\\n5 years 9 months\\nDear Sir/Madam,\\nI am writing this letter to lodge a complaint with you about the unprofessional service I have received recently from one of your shops located in the city centre.\\nOn March 1st, 2020, I visited your shop and purchased an electric cooker, but I encountered a problem with it after a few days as it just stopped working. To get it repaired, I visited your shop again last Monday but during my visit, I was not treated well by your staff members. One of your staff members was not even having patience when I conveyed my concerns, and the worst part was that the product was not taken for service without even checking it! I have travelled around 45 minutes from my home to visit your branch to ask for a service but the experience which I have had was quite disappointing.\\nI would like you to replace this faulty product with a new one. I am expecting you to take immediate action against the staff members who were on the shift on that day.\\nThank you in advance.\\nYours faithfully,\\nSiva Kumar\\nReply\\nQuote\\nLovebabe\\n5 years 10 months\\nDear Sir/Madam,\\nI am writing to complain about an unprofessional service that I experienced at one of your branches at Yellow Junction Road a couple of days ago.\\nIn relation to my visit, I went to your store at Yellow Junction Raod in KuatGram to buy some essentials that I would be using for travelling abroad next week. I purchased seven items in total and after I left the store, perhaps half an hour later to be specific, I noticed that one item was missing. I immediately returned to your store but the staff member who talked to me simply ignored me and behaved as if I made it up! That was utterly disappointing and unprofessional.\\nI am very disappointed with this staff''s unacceptable behaviour. I am hoping you have video cam records to observed what actually went wrong that day. In case I do not hear back from you within next week, I will hire a lawyer to sue your branch on the ground of customer harassment and false accusation.\\nExpecting to hear from you soon.\\nYours respectfully,\\nSusan Babe\\nReply\\nQuote\\nSomu\\n6 years 2 months\\nThe word STAFFS is wrong, STAFF itself is plural.\\nReply\\nQuote\\nDrashti Trivedi\\n6 years 2 months\\nDear Sir/Madam,\\nI am Drashti Trivedi, writing this letter to let you know that I went through a horrible customer service experience when I visited one of your branches last Sunday.\\nI bought a laptop from your brand shop last year. I wished to upgrade my hard disk as I need to save an extensive amount of files and documents. But I could not do it myself as my laptop is still under warranty period and prohibits me to open the hardware or do anything with it. So I visited the nearest branch of your shop in Calgary street with a newly purchased hard disk for that.\\nHowever, I was utterly disappointed with the experience. The behaviour of your employees towards all the customers was rude, to say the least! I understand that it might take a longer period to provide a service to a customer due to excessive rush but it does not justify how they denied receiving our products to offer the service. I waited for more than 2 hours only to be told that I should come the next day. Some of the employees were sitting idly and doing nothing. With much dismay, I had to return home without any solution.\\nI want you to look into this matter and kindly train your staff on how to behave with your customers and provide them the required service.\\nI am looking forward to hearing from you.\\nYours faithfully,\\nDrashti Trivedi\\nReply\\nQuote\\nRola Sabah\\n6 years 9 months\\nI went to your shop, not ''want''!\\nReply\\nQuote\\nChamu\\n6 years 10 months\\nHi,I am Chamu.

I have recently visited your company''s repair shop located on Carter Road to report an issue with my cellphone which I had purchased a couple of days ago and the experience was terrible. I am hoping that you would take the necessary steps to improve your customer service.\\nI visited your shop last Monday with my mobile phone to have it repaired. Despite the fact that I have a valid warranty for the purchased mobile phone, I was denied a free servicing for the faulty feature of the phone. However, I had a word with the store manager which was not very fruitful as he was impolite and without further clarification, I was asked to leave. So after realising that no help will be provided, I vacated the premises. That was disheartening and unprofessional to the least.\\nI would like you to consider my request as a formal complaint against your store manager. Also, I urge you to initiate appropriate actions to assist me to obtain the service, as per the company policy.\\nI look forward to hearing from you soon.\\nYours faithfully,\\nSumeet Jaggi\\nReply\\nQuote\\nSandy\\n6 years 4 months\\nSumit, I guess you have exceeded the word limit, it should shorter than the one wrote.
