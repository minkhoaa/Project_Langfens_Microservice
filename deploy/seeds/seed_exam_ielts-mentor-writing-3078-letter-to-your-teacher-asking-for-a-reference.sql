I am one of your students at the high school where you were teaching chemistry about 12 years ago. I know that it has been a while since I was in touch with you, but now I could really use your help in getting a job which I have always wanted. So, I am writing this letter to ask for a letter of reference from you.\\nI need that letter of reference because I am applying for the position of Manager at a very famous and international group of hotels. By the way, I want this job so badly because it would allow me to travel all over the world and build a solid career in the hotel industry, which I have always wanted to do since my childhood.\\nSo, kindly write a letter of reference for me that would include information like how long you have known me, what kind of student I really was, and whether or not I was involved in any anti-social activities. Please also don’t forget to mention that I was a team leader of the debate team of my high school for a long time.\\nThank you in advance.\\nYours sincerely,\\nJerry Henderson\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 4.44 (9 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nGT Writing Task 1\\nSemi-formal Letter\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\n×\\nReport\\nReport\\nClose"]'::jsonb,
