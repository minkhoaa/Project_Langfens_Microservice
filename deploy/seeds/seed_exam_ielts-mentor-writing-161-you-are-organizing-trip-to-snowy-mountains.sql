Our group has five men, seven women and a married couple - 14 in total. The five men can stay at a dormitory and the women are happy to share rooms, but the married couple would like a deluxe room. We hope to keep our expenses as low as possible. Besides, the rooms must have hot water and room heater facilities considering the cold weather.\\nPlease also inform me about the recreational services in the area. The group will bring their own boots for bushwalking, but we are hoping to hire equipment for other sports, like skiing. Some of our group members will hire geological picks and other equipment, if possible. We also need to know about access to caves and other interesting geological features in the area.\\nI am looking forward to receiving information about the Student Hostel Services and other facilities, specifically, if the accommodation would be available during the time of our visit and if so, how can I reserve it well in advance.\\nYours faithfully,\\nAdam Smith", "Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI have received your contact details from one of my friends who has recently availed of your service.
