  E'["Dear Sir or Madam,\\nMy name is Khoi Vinh, and I am writing this letter to enquire about the possibility of renting a commercial space in the very beautiful shopping mall of yours located at the downtown main street that has just recently been built.\\nI am planning to open a shop for children’s toys in your shopping complex which would require a large space, probably as large as 3,000 square feet, and that too has to be at a prime spot of your shopping complex.  And when I say “prime spot”, I mean to suggest that the shop has to be located in such a position that it can be very easily visible and accessible from all directions.  By the way, I would need such a large space because I am also planning to set up a little playground for children in it.\\nSo, I would like to know if you could provide me with some information about the availability of such commercial space for me as per my requirements.  I would also appreciate it very much if you could possibly quote me a price to rent such a shop at your shopping centre.\\nI would like to hear from you soon.\\nYours faithfully,\\nKhoi Vinh\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 4.71 (7 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nGT Writing Task 1\\nFormal Letter\\nInquiry Letter\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\n×\\nReport\\nReport\\nClose"]'::jsonb,
