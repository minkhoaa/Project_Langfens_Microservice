Anyway, I am getting back to you this time because it looks like I have left my wallet at your home, and I came to find about this only after returning to my home this afternoon.\\nOf course, it is also possible that I might have lost it on our way when we went to buy some snacks and drinks. But, then I remembered clearly that you didn’t allow me to carry my wallet with me yesterday evening since you were so eager to take care of the bills on your own. So, I guess that my wallet is still hiding in one of the drawers of the TV stand inside your living room.\\nYou don’t really need to worry about giving my wallet back to me since, luckily, one of my neighbours drives by your town every weekend in order to see his elderly parents, and all you need to do is to hand him over my wallet whenever he visits you next weekend.\\nTake care and stay fine.\\nWarm wishes,\\nRon Bevan\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 4.80 (10 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nGT Writing Task 1\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\nLara\\n3 years 6 months\\nIELTS GT Writing Task 1:\\nYou have just spent a week with a friend on holiday.

I had a fantastic time with you and your parents during my stay at your house. I enjoyed visiting the arcade, the zoological garden, shopping malls, and dining at the beautiful restaurant across your street.\\nUpon paying my taxi fare, I realized my wallet wasn’t with me. I certainly have left the wallet on the dining table before heading for the airport this morning. There should be about £2000, along with my ID card and driver''s license in it.\\nKindly, send the wallet through the post office tomorrow so that I have it delivered by Monday morning.\\nThanks for everything! Looking forward to meeting with you this summer.\\nBest wishes,\\nOmolara\\nReply\\nQuote\\nCharu\\n5 years 6 months\\nDear Alex,\\nI hope you are doing well, and I already miss you guys. I reached New York early this morning and have just started unpacking my stuff. As you are aware of my hectic work schedule, I must say this was a much-needed break for me to fight stress. And, I shall remain thankful to you and your family for being such a great host and making this trip memorable.\\nThis afternoon when I began unpacking my luggage, I realized that I''ve left my wallet at your house. Last evening, when you insisted me not to carry my wallet as you wanted to bear all the expenses when we went out for dinner, I kept my wallet in your TV room, in a hurry, and later forgot to collect it. As my wallet contains all the crucial items including my driving licence, credit cards, and a few important cards and some money, it is important for me to get access to it.\\nI would really appreciate it if you could courier the wallet at my New York’s residential address at your convenience. Let me know the charges incurred and I will bear the cost.\\nPlease take care and convey my best regards to all.\\nYour bestie,\\nJosh\\nReply\\nQuote\\nParshant Garg\\n6 years 10 months\\nIt will be \\"spend\\" not \\"spent\\".
