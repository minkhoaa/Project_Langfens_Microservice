  E'["Dear Sir or Madam,\\nRecently, I have seen an advertisement in a local newspaper in which you have invited applications from suitable candidates to fill in the position of an Assistant Manager at your apartment complex. So, I would like to apply for the position as I believe that I have the necessary skills and credentials to do the job.\\nTalking about my skills and credentials, I worked as a management trainee for almost nine months at a local super shop right after graduating from high school. Later on, I also worked as a customer service manager for almost 3 years at a 3-star hotel apartment. In these roles, I have successfully assisted my senior managers to perform critical managerial duties while also receiving necessary managerial tips to tackle critical issues. To complement these experiences of mine, I also have received a two-year diploma in business management.\\nBesides, once hired, I would first like to talk to your tenants about the problems they possibly face while also learning about the cost-effective measures to lower your apartment maintenance cost. I hope to meet you and talk in a formal interview at your convenience.\\nYours faithfully,\\nJerry Ferguson\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 3.79 (17 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nGT Writing Task 1\\nFormal Letter\\nApplications\\njob application\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\n×\\nReport\\nReport\\nClose"]'::jsonb,
