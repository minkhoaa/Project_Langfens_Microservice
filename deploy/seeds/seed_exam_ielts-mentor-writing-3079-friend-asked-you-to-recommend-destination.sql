  E'["Dear Samantha,\\nI''m so glad to receive your letter yesterday in which you stated that you are planning for a week-long trip. I''ve got a perfect place in my mind just for you and John.\\nI''m sure you want to make your holiday trip memorable. I had been to Copenhagen, Denmark last summer and it was a great place to be. Copenhagen is a place I cherished so much. It has so much style and beauty, and a dose of good fresh air.\\nI stayed at the Hotel Sanders, opposite the stage door of the Royal Danish Theatre. It had glamorous touches in an otherwise homely space. Their menu is celestial. The first place I visited was Rosenborg Castle- which is 400 years old and was built in the Renaissance style. The Town Hall is another magnificent place on Radhus Square where the zero kilometre stone is located.\\nI absolutely loved a 3-hour sightseeing tour of Copenhagen by bus and boat. I recommend you do the same and see the Danish capital''s famous attractions on a narrated coach tour. It would not cost you much but you will love the experience.\\nFinally, I must mention the food I enjoyed there. With so many hot dog stands all over the city, it’s not hard to notice locals’ love for sausages. Not only they are super tasty but also a cheap solution to fill hunger while roaming around the city. One food you must enjoy is Falafel.\\nI wish you a great trip. Take care and write me back when you are free.\\nWarm wishes,\\nBarbara", "Dear Ron,\\nI am glad to hear from you after such a long time. Hope all is well with you and your family. Anyway, even though I am glad that you have asked for my recommendation for a good place to spend your summer holiday, it also makes me a bit nervous, thinking that you just might not like the place after visiting it. But, I would still suggest that you visit Cyprus since it has one of the best weather in the whole world.\\nBy the way, I stayed in Limassol, a city on the southern coast of Cyprus, after arriving in the country. In fact, the experience of enjoying the celestial view of the entire city of Limassol at night from “Panthea Resort”, located on the hills of Limassol in the middle of all areas, is something beyond any words can describe. Besides, the chance to swim in the clear water of the beautiful Limassol beach and enjoying the fresh Cypriot food and salads will keep your mind captivated for a long, long time.\\nWell, I think that information, I have already given you, should be enough for you to decide whether to choose Cyprus as your holiday destination or not.\\nWishing you a pleasant tour.\\nWarm wishes,\\nRob\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 4.18 (11 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nGT Writing Task 1\\nInformal Letter\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\nSabrina Qamar\\n7 years 5 months\\nDear Mark,\\nHope you and your family are doing well. I am delighted to know that you are planning a holiday with your family. I would like to suggest that you spend your vacation in Dubai.\\nDubai has become one of the most favourite destinations in the world for tourists. I visited Dubai last year with my family, and I must say we had a great time there. First of all, Dubai has many attractions for adults as well as children, alluring beaches, grand shopping malls, amusement parks, adventure parks, science parks are only a few to mention. My vacations fell short in comparison to the places to visit.\\nIn addition, there are many appealing hotels and resorts available for stay there at reasonable prices. I stayed there in Hilton and undoubtedly their service was pleasant. You can also try their traditional Arabic food, which is simply irresistible, along with continental menus.\\nI hope that this suggestion will be helpful to you in taking the decision and you will surely ponder over my suggestion.\\nLet me know your decision soon.\\nYours truly,\\nMichael\\nReply\\nQuote\\n×\\nReport\\nReport\\nClose"]'::jsonb,
