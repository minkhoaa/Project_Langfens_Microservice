  E'["Dear Ms Margaret,\\nI have decided to write this letter to inform you of a few personal ideas that I have about our college cafeteria. As a regular customer, I would like to take the opportunity to express my gratitude to the people behind this cafe and I also believe some improvements would make it even more attractive. I am hoping that you would publish my ideas in your college magazine.\\nI personally feel that our college cafeteria has a great environment and offers delicious and healthy food. I appreciate the hard work of all the chefs and management for their attempt to serve meals to the students who are sometimes fussy and hard to please. The management is in fact, doing an excellent job.\\nHowever, many students and I feel that the food served in the cafeteria is expensive. Our canteen charges $15-$20 for lunch and this is considerably higher. A few other college canteens in our city charges less than that.\\nIt appears that students will soon make an inevitable choice to eat outside the campus due to the high price. As an individual who would love to continue eating fantastic food at our central eatery, I would like to suggest you publish an article about this issue. I hope this will help the canteen management become aware of how we think about their food price.\\nIf you have any further questions about this, please let me know.\\nYours faithfully,\\nKay Lim\\n[ by - Kay Lim]", "Dear Mr Scott,\\nI am writing this letter to bring a couple of issues to your attention with regards to our college cafeteria. I am hoping that you would publish an article related to this in our college magazine in its next publication.\\nI have been going to our college cafeteria since the time I started college, and I have always liked it since then. In fact, the perfect location of the cafeteria, its hygiene and cleanliness, and varieties of the menu – all have contributed greatly to attracting many students from our college. However, when it comes to the prices of some of the food items as well as the customer service, the cafeteria could certainly do some improvements.\\nNow, I understand that the price of the food can be a bit tricky issue to address but I believe that everyone would also agree that some of the foods are overpriced, especially, for college students, many of whom don’t have their own source of income.\\nSo, based on the issues above, I would appreciate it if you publish an article that addresses how this cafeteria is serving us, how the prices of a few food items could be reduced a little and how its staff can be a bit more proactive sooner than later. That would be helpful to all students who eat in the college cafeteria.\\nYours sincerely,\\nAlex Joshua\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 4.50 (12 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nSemi-formal Letter\\nComplaints-letter\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\nNasi\\n1 year 8 months\\nSo perfect!\\nReply\\nQuote\\n×\\nReport\\nReport\\nClose"]'::jsonb,
