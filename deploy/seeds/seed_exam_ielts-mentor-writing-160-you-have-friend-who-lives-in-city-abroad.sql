  E'["Dear Anna,\\nI hope this letter finds you in good health. I am writing to enquire some details about the Certified Internal Auditor (CIA) courses at a leading college in London. As you live there, I am hoping you would be able to guide me in choosing the best college for the course.\\nAs you know, I hail from a family where everyone is involved in the financial sector. Needless to say, I got my tertiary education from a business school, and at present, I am working as an Internal Auditor in a textile corporation, but I have been stuck with the same designation for more than 2 years. Therefore, in order to climb further up the corporate ladder, I would like to update my skills and knowledge, and the most plausible way to do that would be to get a foreign degree from a reputed college in the UK. Having spent a copious amount of hours researching the right institutions, I have narrowed down my options to just three colleges.\\nI would like to ask your assistance in getting in touch with those colleges. Perhaps you could dispatch me their customised brochures or prospectuses since due to the highly complex nature of these programs, the information in the public domain is hard to find about these courses.\\nI look forward to receiving your response.\\nWarm wishes,\\nSameed\\n[", "Dear Mary,\\nIt''s been a long since I have heard from you. Hope you are doing great. I am writing this letter to request some information about the courses offered at different colleges in Brisbane. I am planning to intake a course and would really appreciate your help.\\nAfter completing my postgraduation in chemistry, I have been working as a chemist in one of the best laboratories in India - Dania Lab. My regular duties involve analysing the quality of food products as well as checking whether they meet the NABL prescribed standards. As my employer is highly pleased with my performance, he has asked me if I am ready to take on a new responsibility, which is related to molecular modelling. I do not have much expertise in that field, so, I would like to join a molecular designing course in Australia, more specifically in Brisbane in a couple of months.\\nI would be thankful to you if you search and inform me of the details of the appropriate institution with relevant contact numbers. Please take the burden to personally visit some reputed colleges and talk to them regarding the course.

I am quite confused about which college I should apply to and this is why I am turning to you for advice. I would really appreciate your help regarding this. Also, can you find out what additional qualifications like an English language test score and so on are required to get admitted to such a college?\\nI hope you would not mind doing this for me and I would proceed according to your advice.\\nTake care and write me back when it is convenient for you.\\nBest regards,\\nAnthony", "Dear Aparna,\\nHope you are doing great and enjoying your new job.
