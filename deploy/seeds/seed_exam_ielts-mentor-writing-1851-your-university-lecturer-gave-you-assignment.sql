  E'["Dear Mr Alex,\\nI am George Fernando, a student from the Business Studies department in your university, writing to seek your permission for an extension to submit my assignment that I am supposed to hand over before 14th August 2025.\\nRight after you gave us the task on 17th July, I started working on mine and suddenly caught a severe seasonal flu. I took advice from a doctor and he prescribed some medicines and complete bed rest. I avoided attending classes and visiting the library to avoid spreading the flu virus.\\nFortunately, I am doing better now and hope to get over the flu in a couple of days but I am afraid I will not be able to submit my assignment on time due to my illness. I, therefore, request an extension to hand over my work to you. I am quite positive that I can submit my assignment before 24th August 2025.\\nI would be indebted to you if you permit me to present my assignment before 24th August instead of the 14th of August.\\nYours sincerely,\\nGeorge Fernando", "Dear Mr Watson,\\nHope this letter finds you in good health and spirit. I understand that you feel very strongly about turning in all kinds of assignments on time, but it looks like you will have to make an exception this time around. Let me please explain to you what actually has happened.\\nAbout a few days ago, I, along with a few friends of mine, went to a lake to catch some fish for our upcoming weekend fish barbecue. However, the day, we went outside to catch our fish, was a little chilly, but certainly not enough to make me sick. However, as time progressed, the weather was becoming colder, but we were not exactly in a mood to care about that since we were enjoying our time in the lake while catching one fish after another. But, the next day, I started to feel a terrible fever and headache, because of spending too long in the cold. I am terribly sorry that, due to this, I couldn’t finish the assignment as yet.\\nHowever, I will definitely be able to submit my assignment after three days from now, since I would feel much better by then because of taking medicine. I am hoping that you would allow me to submit my assignment three days later than the initially proposed date. Thank you in advance.\\nYours sincerely,\\nLi Xiu Ying\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 4.18 (11 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nGT Writing Task 1\\nSemi-formal Letter\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\n×\\nReport\\nReport\\nClose"]'::jsonb,
