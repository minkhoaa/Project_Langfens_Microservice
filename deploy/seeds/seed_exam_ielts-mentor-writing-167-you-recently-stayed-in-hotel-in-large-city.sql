  E'["Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI have recently stayed at your hotel - Pan Pacific Perth, in room 324 for three nights. I am writing to inform you that the room heating was ineffectual and despite a great location and friendly staff, I have had a bad experience staying at your hotel. I am hoping you would repair the central heating system so that no guest suffers due to the extreme weather.\\nI stayed at your hotel from 25th May till 27th May and had an excruciating experience as your heating system in my room did not work as expected. The temperature in the city was somewhat unexpected and fell below 7° Celcius during this period. When I found that the room temperature was not comfortable, I called the front desk executive and despite his promise, nothing was done.\\nBecause of the extreme cold in the room, I had to wear socks and a knit hat, take an additional blanket and put on the electric stove all night. Consequently, I got very little sleep over the three nights.\\nI think it would be a good idea to repair the central heating system and be prepared for unusual weather. A room heating system for each room along with the central heating system in the winter would certainly make the rooms more comfortable. Perhaps you would consider giving me a discount if I stay at your hotel next time.\\nI look forward to hearing from you soon.\\nYours faithfully,\\nWalker Luise", "Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI have recently stayed in your hotel - Ibis Hotel Heidelberg, for about a week. The temperature was unusually higher during this period and unfortunately, the air conditioner in my room was not fully operational. I am writing this letter to complain about the bad experience I have had due to this and would like you to take steps so that it does not happen again.\\nI checked into the hotel at midnight on 14th July and straightaway went to bed. However, after turning the air conditioner on, I realised that the room was not getting cooler and the room temperature was peculiarly high.\\nSubsequently, I called the hotel staff to solve the problem but they could not do anything. Moreover, no other room was available. Consequently, I had to stay in this room and open the windows and rely on natural air to cool my room. I had to sleep in skimpy clothes, which I do not prefer, to overcome the heat. Noise from the street came through the open windows and my sleep was disrupted.\\nTherefore, I want you to refund 40% of my hotel charges or provide me with a free stay in a deluxe room next time I check into your hotel.\\nYours faithfully,\\nJohn Vyas\\n[", "Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI am writing this letter in order to inform you about some issues at your hotel which I had to deal with.  My name is Peter Moore, and I stayed at your hotel on the 27th and 28th of April. I believe that I stayed in room number 231. Anyway, while the room looked nice, I am afraid that I wasn’t really very happy with the cooling system of your hotel.\\nNow, I understand that it was a bit unusual for the time of the year to be so hot, but it was also expected that the cooling system of your hotel was up to the standard to offset the effect of that unusually hot weather. Of course, I tried to play with the AC remote to make myself feel cool and comfortable, but luck was not with me. So, I finally had to take a shower several times to cool my body down. Due to this, I could hardly sleep at night!\\nAnyway, I guess, I have made my point already. So, I would like to request you to please check your heating and cooling system more regularly to make sure that they are in perfect working condition at all times.\\nYours faithfully,\\nPeter Moore\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 4.63 (15 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nGT Writing Task 1\\nFormal Letter\\nComplaints-letter\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\nBhipesh Kumar\\n4 years 6 months\\nYou recently stayed in a hotel in a large city.

I am writing this letter to express my dissatisfaction with my stay at your hotel due to the air conditioner malfunctioning amid extremely hot weather.\\nIt was notably sunny and hot outside and I hoped it would be cool enough inside my room. Unfortunately, the air conditioner inside my room did not work properly. I called the reception area and they said they would send an electrician immediately. Surprisingly, nobody came and I had to spend an uncomfortable night. I took a shower twice that night to get cool.\\nThe next day, upon repairing the air conditioner it made a strange noise that disturbed me the whole night. So I had to shut it off and use the fan on a remarkably hot summer night. This was an unpleasant experience to stay at your hotel, to say the least. This was unacceptable as I had paid a huge amount for my stay at this star-rated hotel.\\nI really hope that upon reading these issues, you would reply to me with a plausible explanation. I also expect a refund from the money I have already paid.\\nYours faithfully,\\nBhipesh Kumar\\nReply\\nQuote\\nSodaba\\n6 years 9 months\\nDear Sir or Madam,I have recently stayed at your hotel KCC for about two nights in room 234. During my stay, the temperature was unusually higher in the city. I am writing you this letter to complain about the cooling system of the room that I stayed in. It did not work properly and due to this, I have had a bad experience during my stay at your hotel.I stayed at your hotel from 15th June till 17 June. While I realized that the cooling system of the room is not working, I called the front desk executive. Despite his promise, nothing was done. I kept the window open both nights for natural air to cool the room, and mosquitoes rushed in my room due to an open window and I couldn''t sleep all night.I would like you to check your all systems and services in the rooms before you check in any customer. Consequently, I want a 40% refund for my payment or a discount for my next stay at your hotel.I am looking forward to hearing your reply.Yours faithfully,Mark Vegeburger\\nReply\\nQuote\\nVineeth\\n10 years 5 months\\nDear Manager,I am writing to complain about the worst experience I had during my stay at your hotel May Flower. My name is Mr Jones and I am a business man. I stayed in your hotel at room number 201 on 2nd of this month to preside over some business deals with some entrepreneurs there. To my surprise, I found that air conditioning in the room was not working properly, absolutely contraindicated for such a meeting. I called up reception only to know that no maintenance staff was available that time. At last, I had to do some quick arrangement for the same meeting at a neighbour hotel at my expense. I would not apologise to say that my stay at your hotel was an awful experience, to avoid such things for future I would suggest you run your hotel with a more efficient staff resource Thanking youJones.\\nReply\\nQuote\\nSaundra\\n11 years 5 months\\nExcellent resources for the GT IELTS test takers.
