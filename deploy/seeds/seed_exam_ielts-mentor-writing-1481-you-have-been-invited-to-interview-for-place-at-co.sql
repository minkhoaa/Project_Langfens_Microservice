  E'["Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI have been accepted to join the Masters of Science programme in the winter semester at your college. I am supposed to meet you in an interview next Monday morning but I am afraid the timing contradicts another important meeting. I am hoping that you would allow me to meet you sometime later on that day or on a different day.\\nI work with Optus Telecom and they have scheduled a general meeting on 27th November which contradicts my interview with you. The meeting in the office will start at 9.00 am whereas my interview with you is set at 10.00 am on the same day. I understand how important it is for me to meet you to finalise my admission and hoping that you would allow me to alter the timing as I really cannot make it at 10 am on 27th November.\\nI sincerely apologize for the inconvenience and I request you to kindly reschedule my interview for another day or after 2 pm on the same day. For this, I shall always be thankful to you. Also, kindly let me know if I need to take any tests as part of the interview process and how long the interview might continue.\\nI am looking forward to hearing from you soon.\\nYours faithfully,\\nNamrata Roy\\n[ by -\\nNamrata\\n]", "Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI have received your invitation for an interview on 14th May at 11.00 in the morning to finalise my admission to the MBA programme at your college and I profoundly thank you for that. Unfortunately, I cannot come at the specified time because of another commitment. I am hoping that you would allow me to meet you on a different date.\\nI am working with a multinational company for the last three years and they have scheduled a seminar on the same day at 10.30 am. The company has designated me to attend the seminar and I can not skip it. It will start in the morning and continue till 4.00 pm in the afternoon. This makes it impossible for me to meet you in the interview at the scheduled time.\\nPlease accept my apology for not being able to attend the interview as planned. However, I can meet you any other day whichever is convenient for you. Meanwhile, I would appreciate it if you could tell me the duration of the interview. Also, will it be an oral interview only or do I have to take a test as well?\\nOnce again my sincere apology for not attending the interview at the scheduled time.\\nI look looking forward to hearing from you soon.\\nYours faithfully,\\nMansoor Afzal\\n[by -\\nMansoor Afzal\\n]\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 4.90 (10 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nGT Writing Task 1\\nFormal Letter\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\n×\\nReport\\nReport\\nClose"]'::jsonb,
