I am utterly regretful about that. I had no idea that the noise would reach your flat and cause you trouble. Please accept my sincere apology and I assure you that I will be more careful from now on.\\nAs you may have guessed, I am trying to refit my kitchen in the evening when I get back from my office. Unfortunately, it is taking longer than expected and I have been having problems with getting things to fit properly. The banging and hammering must have created the cacophony and I should have been more cautious.\\nAs the kitchen work is still not finished, I have decided to call a professional after reading your letter. I will instruct him to keep the noise level as minimum as possible and the work should be done in the next two or three days. I will make sure he works only during the daytime, so you will not be disturbed in the evening again.\\nI am really sorry to have caused you the problem.\\nYours sincerely,\\nGorner Brek", "Dear Mrs. Martha,\\nI hope this letter finds you well.

First and foremost, please accept my sincere apologies for any disturbance my actions may have caused you and your family.\\nI understand that noise can be disruptive and frustrating, and I want to assure you that I take your concerns seriously. The noise you have been hearing is primarily due to renovation work being carried out in the kitchen of my flat. I recently undertook a project to upgrade the kitchen, including installing new appliances, cabinets, and countertops. While these renovations are necessary to improve the functionality and aesthetics of my home, I understand that the noise generated from the construction activities may have been disruptive to you and other neighbours.\\nIn light of your complaint, I am taking immediate action to address the noise issue. I will make every effort to minimize noise levels during late hours and ensure that any future activities are conducted with greater consideration for our neighbours.\\nOnce again, I apologize for any inconvenience caused and appreciate your understanding and patience.

The decorators had to relocate all my furniture to complete their work. They also used some heavy machinery to complete their endeavour. That is why you have been catching all these loud noises.\\nI understand that I owe you an apology as all these ruckuses were caused due to me and I should have informed you beforehand. Anyway, I do apologize, and I will owe you a cup of coffee for this. I hope we will still be on friendly terms after this incident.\\nAbout the sound problem, I have already instructed the personnel to tone down the noise level, so your apartment should already be relatively silent. I hope this measure is enough to appease you. By the way, the work will be completed tomorrow.\\nThanks for your patience on this matter. Please come by tomorrow evening and I will show you around my freshly revamped flat.\\nYours Sincerely,\\nLisa Moon\\n[Authored by - Moon]\\nQuestion:\\nYour neighbours have recently written to you to complain about the noise from your house flat.\\nWrite a letter to your neighbours.

Therefore, I have to rehearse every day because I am eager to make a good impression on my teachers. To achieve my goal, I have been practising for about 3 hours a day for the last week.\\nI must apologise for playing at inappropriate hours. It was all my fault since I did not clearly know the rules of our apartment that prohibit playing any musical instrument loudly. However, I have consulted with my class teacher and he suggested that I should use one of the college rooms to rehearse for a small fee. I assure you that you will not be disturbed again by any means by the noise from my flat.\\nI request your forgiveness. Please, accept this box of homemade cookies as a token of my appreciation.\\nYours sincerely,\\nMark Arthur", "Dear Mr and Mrs Martin,\\nHope you are doing great.

Admittedly, I had no idea that the noise would reach your house at all. I am writing to apologise.\\nLast Monday one of my windows in the kitchen was broken as a cricket ball hit it directly while some children were playing in front of my flat. I tried to refit the window in the evening after I got back from the office.

To clear the exam, we need to play multiple musical instruments with different songs. I am practising with a guitar and a flute to create a good impression on the examiners. I am remorseful that I was practising at night due to which you suffered. I did not realize I was so loud. I had words with my professor and he has allowed me to take one of the classrooms for practising in the evening. In the daytime, I will practise at my friend’s place so that the noise does not irritate anyone in the neighbourhood.\\nOnce again, I am extremely sorry for any annoyance caused by my actions.\\nYours Sincerely,\\nAkshay Saf\\n[", "Dear Mr Thompson,\\nI hope that you are doing well. I am writing to apologise for the inconvenience caused by the party held at our residence last Saturday night. I am hoping that you will accept my apology.\\nWith regards to the unexpected noise - it was created by the celebration of my parents'' 40th wedding anniversary. You can imagine that we wanted to make the occasion really special to commemorate our parents'' 4 decades of a beautiful journey together. I went to your flat to invite your family but you were away for the week.\\nWe invited some close friends and relatives to the party and the gathering must have created the noise. I fathom the children were shouting loudly whenever they were presented with a toy. Moreover, they were running and shouting for fun. The music was also a bit louder and we realised very late that it might disturb the neighbours.\\nAt such parties, I would ensure in future that the music is kept as low as possible and arrange some fun games for children that would keep them busy and less noisy.\\nOnce again I would like to ask for an apology.

I can assure you that I will take the necessary steps to prevent it in the future.\\nAs you are aware, I am a musician by profession and my work requires me to do rehearsals before a performance at odd times. In addition to this, I also provide coaching to music students in the morning. Although, I am sincere about making sure that the noise level remains low and within the range of my property, it is quite clear that it was higher this time.\\nTo address the problem of high noise levels, I have called a friend of mine who is an expert in sound engineering. He has suggested ways to contain this noise problem by installing noise cancellation frames on windows and doors and making the room airtight. It may cost me a significant amount but should work in the long run. Please know that making the modification to the existing arrangement will take up to a month.\\nI am afraid that you will have to tolerate noises for some more time, though I will try my best to keep it to a minimum, and hope that you will be agreeable to the proposed solution.\\nAgain, I regret the inconvenience caused to you.\\nYours sincerely,\\nPrateek Roy\\n[Authored by - Prateek]\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 3.91 (48 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nGT Writing Task 1\\nSemi-formal Letter\\nIELTS Apology Letter\\nLetter Writing Sample\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\nAkash Mittal\\n3 years 9 months\\nDear Mr and Mrs Albert,\\nI am writing this letter with regard to the issue you have recently raised about the noise from my house last Sunday evening.\\nThe reason for that noise was that renovation work was going on in my house for the past week.

Last night, our family along with our relatives gathered in my flat to welcome my brothers’ family who was staying in Canada for the last 10 years.

I wasn''t aware that the noise would create so much inconvenience for you and your family.Actually last Saturday due to the wind storm, the window of my bedroom was broken. Also, the bedroom was affected as well. That is why on Sunday I called the labour in order to fix the window and the door. They used some heavy drilled machine in order to make a hole in the wall and iron grill of the window. They also used some grinder machines in order to cut the glass of the window to fix accordingly.I was not aware that the noise that was generated from these electronic devices and by the labours would actually reach your house and disturb your family.However, the window and the door are fixed now and I am extremely sorry for the unease faced by you on last Sunday due to the noise generated. I assured you that in such cases in the future.

Let me explain what happened yesterday in my flat and kindly accept my plea. It all started when we decided to renovate our house. The decoration contractor had to remove all the old finishing materials and replace it with a new one and this needed the use some demolish-equipment. He used a big iron hammer to remove the wall painting, a grinding machine to cut the floor tiles, and few other tools to have the task done and this generated a loud noise. This is why the loud noise reached to you. Therefore I have decided to instruct the contractor to shift his working hours. It will be from 9:30 am till 4:30 pm excluding weekends and this is to avoid making noise when people will be home.Please accept my apology and hope the new planned hours will eliminate noise during your rest hours.Yours sincerely,Ibrah im Albassel.\\nReply\\nQuote\\nPavi\\n9 years 8 months\\nDear John,I am terribly sorry for the inconvenience you experienced due to the noise from my house. I have received your complaint letter earlier today and writing to explain the whole situation and to express my earnest apology.Firstly, I want to let you know that I''ve recently purchased a new dog and it has been making a lot of noises since then. Probably it was not ready to accept the new house and people. Moreover, two of my friends have been living in my house from the last 3 days and they have a habit of listening music in loud volume. Good news is that the dog is no longer barking and it is acting normal now. Besides, my friends will be gone tomorrow and I have already talked to them about the loud music. I apologise again for not taking care of these issues earlier. I hope you can understand my situation and forgive me for the trouble you had to go through because of me. I would like to know more about you and your family and would be very glad if you can visit us anytime you like.Yours faithfully,Pavi .\\nReply\\nQuote\\nPrabin Gurung\\n9 years 9 months\\nDear, Meline,I am terribly sorry to learn that you could not sleep well last night due to the disturbing noise from my apartment.Well, it was from our room as we had a big party and accumulated around twenty people to celebrate my son’s graduation and there were few children too. Children played and shouted loudly. I think you might have heard their voices and the noise of the party while you tried to sleep. For all of this, I would like to apologise from the bottom of my heart and on behalf of my family. I understand that you have been terribly annoyed by the disturbance. However, I hope you will take it positively, accept my apology. I really appreciate your tolerance. I would like you to visit our home tomorrow evening and have a cup of tea with us. I promise next time I will be more careful about throwing a party at night.Thank you so much.Sincerely,Prabi n Gurung.\\nReply\\nQuote\\nChaitanya\\n9 years 10 months\\nDear Mrs Praveena,I hope you are doing well. Yesterday I received a letter from you mentioning the noise from my home. I really apologise for this disturbance from my side.Due to the heavy rain and the thunderstorm, my kitchen window was broken and the air was coming from the balcony to make the window door flap around. I didn''t notice it until I went through your letter yesterday. Today I escalated the problem to the apartment maintenance section and they promised me that they will resolve the issue within the next two days. Henceforth, I assure you that there will not be any sound disturbance from my home and thank you very much for your kind notification of the issue and not for complaining to the apartment authority. I again heartily regret that inconvenience and I really appreciate your kind cooperation. Thanks and Regards Chaitanya.\\nReply\\nQuote\\nKrupa\\n9 years 11 months\\nDear John, I hope you are doing well and I am writing this letter to express my apology for the inconvenience caused due to the noise from my house. I really feel sorry about this and sincerely ask for your forgiveness. As you are aware that there is drainage problem in our block and last week when I turned back from office; I found that there was the huge water logged in my bathroom. Hence I decided to resolve the drainage problem and I have asked some plumbers to carry out the work on urgent basis. They need to change the old pipes and it would take 2 more days to complete the work. I am really sorry for the disturbance created by the noise and hope to finish the work at the earliest. I hope you would understand the situation and forgive me.Yours SincerelyKrupa\\nReply\\nQuote\\nTrey\\n9 years 11 months\\nDear Neighbours,Than k you for bringing your complaint to my attention, I apologise for the discomfort that you have been experiencing since yesterday with the loud noise that is coming from my house.As you might have noticed, I had a severe water leak problem due to a broken water pipe which is located in the foundations of the house, this leakage has caused a massive flood in my basement and is damaging all the surrounding structure.For this reason, I had to hire a company specialized in floods, to pump out the water from the affected area. The water pumps that are being used for this purpose are very noisy but, unfortunately, is the only available way to drain the water from the flooded area.I understand the discomfort that this is causing you, and I apologize for all the inconvenience associated with this issue. Also, I must ask you for additional patience and understanding with the problem that I am facing these days. I can assure you that the pumps will be in operation just until 4:00 pm and for 2 more days.Sincerely,Trey.\\nReply\\nQuote\\nJake\\n10 years 6 months\\nDear Mark,Greetings, I hope you are doing fine, I am writing you this letter to send my apology. I was surprised this morning when I saw a letter in my mailbox and it came from you. As I read your letter I found out that you are complaining about the noise we made during the night.Let me explain my side on this letter. During the evening my children and I used to play some games. Since most of the time of the day I am at work, we used this time as for bonding moment as father and children. We never expected that noise we created would reach to your place my deepest apology. As a promise we will change the time of our play, we might have our playing time during the afternoon after office hours so that we will not disturb you during your resting time. Once again my deepest apology for the inconvenient we had made.Sincerely yours,Jake.\\nReply\\nQuote\\nNima\\n10 years 6 months\\nDear Mr Alfred,I am writing to express my apology about the noise from my house. I received your letter regarding the noise from my flat and I am writing to explain the whole situation and to express my deep apology. As you know approximately fortnight ago, water pierced the main pipe of my kitchen and I had to dig the kitchen floor and change this. This process should have been finished last week but I found water still licking from the pipe. So I changed all the pipes of my kitchen and altered the kitchen floor ceramic. Fortunately workers who have been doing this in my kitchen promised me that their work will be done tomorrow. I hope that would finish the unpleasant noise that has been annoying you. By the way, I am very sorry about this event and I know you can imagine my situation but I want to invite you for dinner at this weekend. I’m looking forward to hearing from you and would be very glad if you accept my invitation. Sincerely yours, Nima Mirabedini\\nReply\\nQuote\\n×\\nReport\\nReport\\nClose"]'::jsonb,
