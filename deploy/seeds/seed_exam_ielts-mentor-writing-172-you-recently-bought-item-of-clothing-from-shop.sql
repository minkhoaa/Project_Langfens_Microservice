  E'["Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI am a loyal customer of your store in Elizabeth supermarket and writing to complain about a recent poor customer service that I experienced at your shop. Last week, I purchased a dress from your store and unfortunately, it was faulty. When I returned it to your store for a replacement, I was told that it is not possible.\\nI bought a white trendy top from your store on 16th April. When I tried it in the shop, it looked alright to me. However, when I showed it to my roommate, I realised that a stain on the back was visible, hence it is not wearable. I believe I was not given the product that I trialled at your store. I went to the store the next day to get it replaced.\\nTo my utter dismay, the sales assistant mentioned that once an item is sold, it cannot be exchanged or refunded as per the store''s policy. I completely understand it. However, it is unfair that a customer has to suffer due to a staff''s mistake or dishonesty. I have not removed the price tag from the dress and it is clearly visible that the stain is very old. The order number is WD-52417 and I paid $189 for the item.\\nI believe this matter deserves your immediate attention. I would appreciate it if you could replace the top or refund the money. It would certainly increase my confidence in your customer care services as well.\\nLooking forward to your prompt action.\\nNaaz Anna\\n[", "Dear Sir or Madam,\\nThree days ago I bought a green long-sleeve jumper from your store. I was excited to have a 40% discount on the product but very disappointed to notice that the item was defective. I am hoping you would replace it with a new one or refund me the money.\\nI bought the jumper from your store on 2nd June and it is medium-sized cotton-made clothing. When I got home, I discovered a small hole in the left sleeve of the jumper. It looks like a rip of some kind and the stitching has unravelled. I visited your shop the next day to ask for an identical replacement. Unfortunately, the stock was not available. Therefore, I asked for a refund. However, the shop assistant refused to give me a refund and said it was against the store policy. It cost me $59.95 and the order number is JB54874520. I am attaching a receipt with this letter.\\nI am writing to demand a refund or, at the very least, a replacement. The jumper is unwearable as it is and I do not want to buy anything else. I hope that you can assist me in this matter. If I do not hear from you within the next three days, I will be forced to seek legal advice.\\nYours faithfully,\\nAmber Crew", "Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI am writing this letter to complain about a problem which I find a bit troubling, to say the least.\\nRecently, I bought a shirt from your store at a discounted price. After taking that shirt home, I found out that it had a tiny hole just under the collar. Now, you might argue that it was my fault since I did not check the shirt carefully before purchasing it. In response, I would just say that it was not actually easy to learn about the tiny hole since it was hidden under the collar.\\nAnyway, as soon as I found out about the fault, I requested one of your store assistants for a complete return, but I was told that I would not get any refund since it was the store policy not to give any refund on an item which is sold on discount.\\nSo, in light of this frustrating situation, I would like to request you to please take appropriate action for the sake of your store’s reputation and issue me a full refund for the defective shirt. If I do not hear from you within the next seven days, I will file a written complaint to your head office.\\nYours faithfully,\\nMitch O’Conner\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 4.43 (7 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nGT Writing Task 1\\nFormal Letter\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\nSun Shine\\n7 years 10 months\\n;-) :lol: :lol:\\nReply\\nQuote\\n×\\nReport\\nReport\\nClose"]'::jsonb,
