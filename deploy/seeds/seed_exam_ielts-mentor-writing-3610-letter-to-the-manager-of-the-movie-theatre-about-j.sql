  E'["Dear Sir or Madam,\\nMy name is Justin Phillip, and I am reaching out to you to ask for a favour. I left my jacket at your theatre a couple of days ago, and I would like you to help me get it back.\\nI left my jacket at your movie theatre by mistake when I went there to watch a movie on 19th August. Not sure why or exactly how I could have possibly made such a silly mistake, but I guess that I might have just left it by my side unconsciously as I was probably feeling a bit too hot inside the theatre.\\nTo give you some information about my jacket, it is black in colour, fully made of leather, and it also had a round neck. The jacket does not have any zipper, instead, it has some buttons. And as far as where I could have possibly left my jacket, I was sitting on the third row, from behind, on the first floor.\\nPlease try to find my jacket, and mail it to me in a courier mail service at your earliest convenience. I have given my address with this letter. I would be much obliged.\\nYours faithfully,\\nJustin Phillip\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 3.46 (14 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nGT Writing Task 1\\nFormal Letter\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\n×\\nReport\\nReport\\nClose"]'::jsonb,
