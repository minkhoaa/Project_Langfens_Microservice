  E'["Dear Sir or Madam,\\nAs a local resident, I would like to protest the development of our local airport as it would bring many negative consequences. I am writing to request you to publish an editorial in your newspaper regarding the problems the expansion of the local airport would cause.\\nI live near the Bogra International Airport where more than two thousand citizens, including children and older people, reside. Living near the airport is already difficult as harsh noises are frequent, especially at night when the aeroplanes land or depart the runway. If the number of flights is increased, the noise will become unbearable. This could result in immense distress to the people. Besides, it would worsen the traffic condition of the adjacent roads.\\nMoreover, the airport authority wants to expand the area; so our lovely park, which is essential for every citizen of this locality, will be diminished.

If you agree with me, please publish an editorial in your newspaper to disagree with this unnecessary and detrimental development.\\nI am looking forward to hearing from you soon.\\nYours faithfully,\\nShohag Khan\\n[", "Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI am writing to express my deep concern about the proposed expansion of Toronto Airport, which is set to increase the number of flights in our area. As a resident of Ontario, living just a few kilometres from the airport, I believe this development will bring significant negative consequences for our community. I am hoping that you will publish a news report about it and promote a voice to stop the expansion of the airport.\\nThe primary issue with this expansion is the inevitable rise in noise pollution. Currently, the sound of aircraft is already disruptive, especially during early mornings and late nights. Increasing the number of flights will only exacerbate this, affecting the sleep and well-being of thousands of residents. Furthermore, the additional air traffic will lead to higher levels of air pollution, posing health risks to children, the elderly, and those with respiratory conditions.\\nFrom an environmental perspective, expanding the airport contradicts efforts to reduce carbon emissions. Instead of investing in larger airports, resources should be directed towards sustainable transport solutions. I urge local authorities to reconsider this plan and seek alternatives that prioritise community welfare over commercial interests. I hope you will include this in your report.\\nYours faithfully,\\nJames Weston", "Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI am writing to express my disagreement with the decision to expand the Miami International Airport as it has many detrimental consequences. My home is situated on Callos street - next to the airport, and I am hoping that you would publish an editorial to protest the development.\\nThe residents are constantly confronted with the noise and turbulence problems, created by the flights arriving and departing the airport. This is a significant issue as a major part of our population comprises young school children. The nuisance does not allow the old people a peaceful night either. Moreover, the commotion caused by the flight sometimes results in cracks or even broken glass doors and house cabinets.\\nNow given the situation, I believe that Miami is not among the front line airports of the country and there is a restriction imposed by the government on the number of flights operated daily. I would like to plea to the president an obstruction on this plan because an expansion of the airport will aggravate the problems in our community. An increase in the number of flights will cause more turbulence and nuisance, which is explicit. I am not against any development in our country and I believe it would be ideal if the authority could come up with an alternate approach to this issue.\\nLast but not least, I would request your editorial section to publish a report on this moot issue.\\nIn anticipation of your favourable action.\\nYours faithfully,\\nJones Nathan\\n["]'::jsonb,
