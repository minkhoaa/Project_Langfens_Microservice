  E'["Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI have recently bought a Samsung digital camera from your showroom. I was excited to bring it home but disappointed to find that it did not work as expected. To add more misery, even after I returned it to your store to claim the warranty, I am yet to hear an update. I am hoping to get my camera replaced by a new one.\\nI have bought a Samsung NX410 40MP camera from 125 Oxford St, Soho showroom on 10th December. Unfortunately, it malfunctioned just after I took it home. I cannot take pictures and it turns off automatically. The very next day, I visited your showroom and talked to Cynthia, one of your representatives, who assured me that the camera would be replaced within 24 hours. When I called her again, she told me that it would take a few more days and would be repaired instead of being replaced. When I demanded the reason, she failed to answer.\\nIt has been almost a week since I purchased the camera from your store. The faulty product should be your responsibility, not mine. One of my relatives has advised me to talk to the Consumer Rights Authority and file a complaint against your company but I will wait till 24th (the day before Christmas). I am attaching the receipt of the purchase.\\nI still believe in your brand reputation. I would like you to take immediate action against the misconduct I experienced.\\nYours faithfully,\\nGinna Maria", "Dear Sir or Madam,\\nA week ago I purchased a Sony digital camera from your store. I was excited when I brought it home but very disappointed to find that the product was faulty and unusable. I am 28 years old and working in a private company. I am hoping you will replace it.\\nIn relation to the specifics of the order, I purchased this Sony - Cyber-shot DSC-HX80 18.2-Megapixel Digital Camera from your store on April 17th using my Visa credit card. The order number is D4582135 and I am attaching a copy of my receipt.\\nThe issue with the camera is that sometimes it turns off unexpectedly, strange dots appear on the LCD screen and I cannot access the photos in internal memory, so I’m sure these are manufacturing flaws.\\nAs a solution, and because I really like the functionality of the camera, I am hoping that you will agree to replace the faulty one with a new and fresh one. Otherwise, I would like a full refund. If I do not hear back from you in regards to this within a week, I would like to lodge a written complaint to your higher authority.\\nThank you for giving the matter your attention and I hope to hear your reply soon.\\nYours faithfully,\\nOliver Felix\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 4.65 (10 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nGT Writing Task 1\\nFormal Letter\\nComplaints-letter\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\nAdyasha Pradhan\\n4 years 8 months\\nA complaint letter on the slow internet connection for the past few days.
