  E'["Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI am writing this letter to notify you of my concerns about my current roommate, who is making my stay in the college hostel difficult. I am having unavoidable and unmanageable problems due to her activities and those are impacting my study badly.\\nMy name is Mary Smith, and I live in room L-202, which I share with another student. My previous housemate was rational, extremely cooperative and inclined to study. However, my present roommate is the polar opposite and have frequent parties in which he plays loud music in the wee hours. He is two years senior to me and I cannot protest her irrational behaviours due to which my studies are being hampered.\\nI would prefer anything quiet. My semester final is approaching and I would like you to shift either me or my roommate to another room. I do not mind the room type as long as it is quiet and favourable for studies.\\nThank you very much for your consideration.\\nYours faithfully,\\nMary Smith", "Dear Sir or Madam:\\nI would like to bring my accommodation issues, created specifically due to my roommate''s irrational behaviours, to your immediate attention. I cannot concentrate on my studies and find it unbearable to live with such a housemate. I am hoping that you allow me to shift into another room soon.\\nI have been living in a hostel with shared accommodation for the last year. My previous roommate was extremely cooperative and friendly. There was nothing he was not willing to solve together with me as a roommate. However, the student I have been living with for the past two months is quite the opposite. He refuses to collaborate with me and doesn’t clean the room. He has frequent visitors and they smoke in the room. To make things worse, my roommate has bought a television lately and likes to watch the television all the time with a high volume. Even after my cordial requests, he refuses to cooperate and I find it extremely tough to live with such a roommate and study properly.\\nI want to move out of this room as soon as possible and have a different roommate. I would prefer a single room with kitchen and bathroom facilities. If arranging a single room is not possible, I would like any room that is peaceful.\\nI am looking forward to hearing from you soon.\\nYours faithfully,\\nEva Morris\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 4.70 (22 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nFormal Letter\\nComplaints-letter\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\nUdara\\n3 years 4 months\\nDear Sir/ Madam,\\nI am writing this letter to describe the situation in my accommodation arrangement which is causing me great difficulties, especially in my academic studies. The room in which I live is quite good, but I am not happy with the infrastructure facilities in my room.\\nThe first problem is there are a few tiny holes on the roof, therefore, I can not do my day-to-day work on rainy days. The room also has an unlockable window, and it makes an annoying noise. Also, it is a huge security problem because there are so many electric devices in my room that could attract thieves. Finally, there is no proper shower in the washroom and it needs a mirror too.\\nWould you please make sure these basic needs are being taken care of as soon as possible? Or, could you please at least arrange another room, which would be better than this, for me?\\nI look forward to your reply and a resolution to my problem.\\nYours faithfully\\nUdara U\\nReply\\nQuote\\nAlex Gracias\\n3 years 8 months\\nDear Sir/Madam,\\nI am writing to you to inform you about the difficulties I am facing with my new roommate who has moved into my room a few months ago.\\nI am a 4rd-year B.Tech student accommodated in B-Block of the university hostel and preparing for my final year exams. So it is essential that my concentration on my studies is spot on, and I am completely focused. However, my new roommate is making this a lot more difficult for me. He has his friends coming and staying almost every day, and throughout the day, they are either playing video games or having parties and playing loud music.\\nThis is causing a lot of inconvenience for me as I cannot focus on studying due to this commotion. I have approached him on multiple occasions to explain my situation, but he seems to be very inconsiderate and oblivious about it.\\nMy final exams are around the corner and my examination result will have a big effect on my career path and success. Therefore, I am requesting you to change my accommodation to a single room that is not shared with anyone else. This would benefit me incredibly and help me focus on my studies.\\nYours faithfully,\\nDaniel Sullivan\\nReply\\nQuote\\nMirunalini Sathasivam\\n4 years\\nDear Sir or Madam,\\nI am writing this letter to inform you about the problems that I am facing with the shared accommodation that I have. I find it very difficult to concentrate on my academics due to this, and expecting your help with it.\\nWith regards to the problems, my current roommate often brings his friends and they play video games in high volume till late at night. I can not focus on my studies because of the noise and gathering they make. I am in my final semester and I need to complete the project which is crucial for my overall CGPA and learning. I am currently living in the boys'' hostel and my room number is L12. My roommate has set up a television and a video gaming console which takes up a lot of space, which makes the already smaller room even smaller.\\nAs a solution to these problems, I would be grateful if you can arrange a different room for me. I would prefer a single room with a kitchen and a bathroom. If you can not find a single bedroom, I would not mind sharing a room with a final year student.\\nI am looking forward to hearing from you soon.\\nYours faithfully,\\nRaj Sathasivam\\nReply\\nQuote\\nRasangi Disanayake\\n4 years 7 months\\nDear Sir or Madam,\\nI am writing this letter to inform you about the problems that I am facing because of the shared accommodation that I have. It is quite difficult to concentrate on my studies as my roommate always lets her friends come and stay in the room. When I have my exams, it is even harder to study because of the high pitch music they listen to. I hope you would help me overcome these problems as early as possible.\\nI would really appreciate it if you can advise my roommate regarding this situation because I need to focus on my studies and exams. It is okay if she does that once a week, but the problem is this happens around three to four times per week. After your advice, if she keeps doing this, I would then like to move to a new room with another student. It does not matter which building or room I move to, but I would expect my new roommate to honour my privacy and maintain a conducive environment for study and work.\\nI apologise that I had to bring this unpleasant situation to you, but you are the best person I know who would be able to help me out from this depressing experience.\\nI hope you will take the necessary actions soon.\\nYours faithfully,\\nRasangi Disanayake\\nReply\\nQuote\\nRamnivas\\n6 years 8 months\\nHi, we can have conversations. If yes, please ping me.\\nReply\\nQuote\\nFaisal\\n7 years 4 months\\nDear Sir or Madam,\\nI am writing to you to express my dissatisfaction with my roommates in the Hasbrook hostel where I have been staying for the past seven or eight months.\\nI am a graduate student and I live in a 3-bed-shared room. Two roommates of mine are undergraduate students who study at the same university where I study. However, I find it extremely difficult to concentrate on my studies as my roommates have a lot of visitors and they play video games most of the time. In addition, they have parties almost every weekend. I have tried to talk to them and make the situation favourable but nothing did work! And it is seriously affecting my study and privacy.\\nUnder the circumstances, I would really appreciate it if you could find me another accommodation, preferably in the same area but with graduate students who would be more mature and would understand the type of study loads I will be having in the coming few months. A shared bedroom for two persons would be an ideal choice for me.\\nI look forward to hearing from you soon.\\nYours faithfully,\\nFaisal Sayed\\nReply\\nQuote\\nGurmit\\n8 years 4 months\\nI belong to Dubai and I want speaking partners. I am very poor in English. So, I need to find partners.
