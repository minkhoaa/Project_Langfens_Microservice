  E'["Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI am writing this letter in response to an advertisement, published last week in one of the leading Australian family magazines, where you asked for a short term live-in caregiver for your six-year-old child. I have proper experiences to take the best care of your child, and I would like to take the job.\\nI am confident that I would be able to render a great service in taking care of your child since I have had a good experience in raising a couple of younger siblings as the eldest child of my family. Besides, I love children since I consider them as a bundle of joy, and that is why I took care of some young children as a babysitter in my hometown. In fact, I find children so special that I have taken a short online course on parenting so that I could relate to them in a better way.\\nBy the way, I recently came to visit Australia from my home country at the invitation of my uncle in order to live with him for the next six months or so. And, while I am in Australia, I would also love to explore this beautiful country and learn about the lifestyles and culture of its people in addition to taking care of your child should you choose to offer me the job.\\nYours faithfully,\\nDaria Olga", "Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI am writing to express my interest in the position of \\"live-in caregiver\\" for your six-year-old child, as advertised in the Australian magazine. Spending six months with your family and looking after your child would be a wonderful opportunity for me, as I genuinely enjoy working with children and have experience in childcare.\\nI believe I am well-suited for this role because I have worked as a private tutor and babysitter for the past three years, helping young children with their studies and daily routines. I am responsible, patient, and creative, always ensuring that children under my care are both safe and engaged in meaningful activities. Additionally, I am proficient in cooking nutritious meals and maintaining a structured yet fun environment.\\nDuring my free time in Australia, I plan to explore the local culture, visit historical sites, and improve my English skills through interaction with native speakers.\\nI would love the opportunity to discuss this role further. I look forward to hearing from you soon.\\nYours faithfully,\\nCatherine Elaine\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 3.91 (28 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nGT Writing Task 1\\nFormal Letter\\nLetter Writing Sample\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\nVivek\\n3 years 2 months\\nDear Sir or Madam,\\nI have recently seen an advertisement in an Australian magazine and learned that you are searching for someone to look after your six-year-old child for six months. I am a good candidate to take responsibility for your child. I have more than 2 years of experience in looking after young children.\\nI am a certified medical nurse as I have worked in the paediatric department for the last two years in our home country with 3-8 years old children, but last month, I came here for visiting or having a good work opportunity in future. I live here with my uncle, and for till next 6-8 months, I am not joining any hospital because I want to take the professional GNM exam. So in the meantime, I can look after your child.\\nI am in Australia now and having a really good time with my lovely uncle, aunt, and cousins. I would love to take the professional exam and along with it, do some gardening, play some games and yes on weekend eat some ice cream.\\nOnce again, I would like to say by my profession and experience make me a suitable candidate.\\nYours faithfully,\\nVivekraj Jedhe\\nReply\\nQuote\\n×\\nReport\\nReport\\nClose"]'::jsonb,
