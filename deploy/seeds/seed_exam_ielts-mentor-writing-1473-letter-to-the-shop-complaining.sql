  E'["Dear Sir or Madam,\\nTwo weeks ago I purchased a brand new Revo radio from your store on Baker Street. I was excited to have it but very disappointed to find that the product was poorly produced and unusable. Even after I returned it to your store last Monday to claim the warranty, I have not heard anything yet. I am hoping you will either repair or replace it.\\nIn relation to the specifics of the order, I purchased this Revo Super Signal Deluxe AM/FM Radio from one of your Revo brand shops on August 17th using cash. The order number is 9542105 and I am attaching a copy of my receipt.\\nThe issue with the radio is that I am unable to tune in to any FM radio channel and the sound quality is poor. I’m sure this is a manufacturing flaw.\\nAs a solution, and because I really like the model and functionality of this radio, I am hoping that you will agree to repair the issues or provide me with a fresh one. Otherwise, I would like a full refund and I will be contacting the Consumer Rights Bureau if I do not hear back from you in regards to this within a week.\\nThank you for giving the matter your attention and I hope to hear your reply soon.\\nYours faithfully,\\nRobert Henry", "Dear Sir or Madam,\\nTwo weeks ago I purchased a radio from your store. I was excited to purchase it but disappointed to find that it was faulty. I returned the product with the hope that you would either replace it or repair it but to my dismay, nothing has been done so far. I am hoping that you would either replace or repair it within the next three days.\\nIn relation to the specifics of the order, I bought the radio from your shop from the Blue street branch. But, it was an utter disappointment when the brand new radio was not working as it should have been. The issue with the radio is that it does not tune in to the common channels except for one or two. I talked to your representatives in the shop and they agreed to repair it within a couple of days. Now, it has been a week and the radio is not yet ready. Whenever I call the shop, one of your salesmen promises to deliver the radio within a day. But it is not done yet and all I got is an apology and regret. The order number is 587416 and I am attaching a copy of my receipt.\\nAs a solution, and because I really like the functionality of the radio, please repair the radio within the next three days or replace it with a new one. Otherwise, I will be forced to complain to higher management.\\nThank you for giving the matter your attention and I hope to hear your reply soon.\\nYours faithfully,\\nMansoor Abedi\\n[ by Mansoor]\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 5.00 (7 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nFormal Letter\\nComplaints-letter\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\n×\\nReport\\nReport\\nClose"]'::jsonb,
