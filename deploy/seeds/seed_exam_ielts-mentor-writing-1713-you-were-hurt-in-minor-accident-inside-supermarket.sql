My name is Olivia Belmont, and I am a regular customer at your Toronto City Center branch. I am hoping that you will take enough precautions to prevent such an accident in the future.\\nThe incident occurred in the fresh produce section, where I slipped on a wet floor that had no warning signs. As a result, I fell and sustained minor injuries to my elbow and knee. A staff member assisted me, but I was disappointed by the lack of immediate medical attention or any follow-up regarding the incident.\\nTo prevent such accidents in the future, I strongly recommend ensuring that spills are cleaned promptly and that clear warning signs are placed around hazardous areas. Additionally, regular safety inspections should be conducted to identify and address potential risks.\\nI trust that you will take this matter seriously and implement the necessary measures to ensure customer safety. I would appreciate a response regarding any actions taken.\\nYours faithfully,\\nSophia Lane", "Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI am a regular customer of your renowned supermarket ''Meena Bazar''. Today I am writing to you regarding a minor accident that I faced while visiting your supermarket on 28th November. I am hoping that you would take the necessary measures so that it does not happen to any other shopper.\\nI am Shadia Rahman, a resident of the Banani area and a loyal customer of your shop for more than 3 years. I am a lecturer at a private university and often do my shopping at your mart.\\nIt is a matter of regret that during my last visit to your Banani branch, I found the frozen food area completely wet and slippery. I guess it might have happened due to the inactive freezing system or any kind of technical issue. Also, the lethargic housekeeping was responsible for it. Unfortunately, I slipped my footstep while passing that area since I did not have any idea in this regard. Although I had managed with a small injury, it could have been fatal. I noticed many elderly people shop at your supermarket and it is quite unacceptable to have such an area that can possibly cause harm to people.\\nI believe, Meena Bazar authority is having the best management individuals like you and you would take proper actions after getting it notified. Therefore, in the consideration of its goodwill, you should be more attentive regarding all kinds of safety issues like this. I recommend you to monitor all electronic devices more frequently with professional bodies. Also, you should take the necessary steps to hire a highly skilled and proactive cleaning team.\\nI hope this matter deserves your sound attention. Thank you in advance for your cooperation.\\nYours faithfully,\\nShadia Rahman\\n["]'::jsonb,
