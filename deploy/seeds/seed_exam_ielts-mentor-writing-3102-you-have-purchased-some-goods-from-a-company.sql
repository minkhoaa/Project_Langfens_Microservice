  E'["Dear Sir or Madam,\\nEight days ago I ordered a smart TV, a mobile phone and some accessories from your outlet. I was excited when I ordered these items and got your assurance that I would receive them in three days, but I am very disappointed not to receive them yet. I am hoping that you will complete the shipment by tomorrow.\\nIn relation to the specifics of the order, I purchased a Sony smart TV, a Samsung mobile phone, a screen protector, a memory card and a pocket router from your outlet ''Gadget and Goods'' on July 18th. I paid using my Visa Credit card. The order number is 8683201 and I am attaching a copy of my receipt.\\nSince you did not have the specific model of the TV and silver colour mobile phone at your outlet, you agreed to send the items to my home address before 21st July. Unfortunately, eight days have already elapsed, and I did not hear from you. Please explain the reason for this delay.\\nAs a solution, and because I am a regular customer of your store, I am hoping that you will send my products by tomorrow. Otherwise, I would like to cancel my order. I will contact my bank to reverse the credit card payment if I do not hear back from you in regard to this within a day.\\nThank you for giving the matter your attention and I hope to hear your reply soon.\\nYours faithfully,\\nMichael Keaton", "Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI am Rahul Sharma, the manager of the purchase and procurement division in Delta Bank, Maryland branch, writing to express my concern about the delivery of personal computers and routers I have recently purchased from you. I am hoping to get an update from you immediately.\\nI purchased five Dell PC and two NETGEAR-AC2750 Dual-Band routers and my invoice number is DNR12547A. You personally assured me that you will arrange the delivery in three days, before 25th May to be exact. Unfortunately, it is already 2nd June and I am yet to receive those products!\\nWhat is the reason for the delay? Is this something to do with your product stock or delivery chain? We need those goods as soon as possible, and I can even arrange for one of our cars to pick up these products from your store. Please update me regarding this. If you fail to deliver the products within the next couple of days, I am afraid, I will have to cancel the order.\\nExpecting your cooperation in this regard.\\nYours faithfully,\\nRahul Sharma\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 4.94 (8 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nGT Writing Task 1\\nFormal Letter\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\nGur Singh\\n6 years 1 month\\nDear Sir or Madam,\\nI am writing to bring to your attention that 7 days ago, I purchased a Toshiba TV, a Samsung Vacuum Cleaner and an electric burner from your Hedgemen branch. I was promised that the products will be delivered to my home within three days. However, 7 days have already passed and I have not received the products yet.\\nI have cleared my payment for those products in advance and also paid the shipping charges to receive the products at the earliest. Since a week has already elapsed, I am a bit worried now. Could you please check with the product delivery team and find out the reasons? Also please let me know why the products were not delivered within the promised timeline even after paying the hefty shipping fees?\\nI would like you to look into this matter and ensure product delivery in the next 2 days. Since I have not received the products on time, return the money I paid to expedite shipping. I am looking forward to hearing from you.\\nYours faithfully,\\nG Singh\\nReply\\nQuote\\nSabrina Qamar\\n7 years 8 months\\nYou have purchased some goods from a company and the goods were supposed to be delivered within three days of purchase. Seven days have already gone and you have not received the products yet.Write a letter to a company manager with whom you arranged the delivery of goods. In your letter: - inform him/her what items you have purchased - ask the reason for the delay in delivery - suggest what can be done about the matter. Dear Mr Sammuel,I am Mark Thomas, writing to express my disappointment in regard to your company''s delivery service. I am not happy with the delivery service you offer.On 7th March 2018, I ordered a crying baby doll and a Lego racing car from your online store on occasion of my daughter''s birthday, which is on 12th March. Unfortunately, I have not received the product and it is already 14th March. Relentlessly, I called your customer service department but they failed to assure the timely delivery. This kind of carelessness and negligence will hurt your company''s image.Since the birthday is already over, I do not have any use of the products I have ordered online. I, therefore, claim the full refund.I would like to request you to take this matter seriously and try to inquire about the cause of this unfortunate event. This would be helpful for your business. With regards,Mark Thomas\\nReply\\nQuote\\n×\\nReport\\nReport\\nClose"]'::jsonb,
