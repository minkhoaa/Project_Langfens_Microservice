I am writing to express my immeasurable admiration for your altruistic and brave action.\nI am Simon Annand, a math teacher at the Cherry Blossom high school, and I live with my family at 24 Abbey Rise Street, London. On my way to the school at around 8.30 am last Monday, my motorbike crashed with a private car near Aberdeen Drive and I lost control. I was severely injured and could not move or pick up my bike. If you had not decided to help me, the situation could have been worse.\nI am so grateful to you for your kind help and generous words. You even took the burden to take me to a nearby hospital and that was so noble of you. I cannot express enough how thankful I am to you. When my parents and wife heard about how courageously you assisted me, they prayed for you even though they have never met you before.\nI regret that I could not thank you enough. Please accept my invitation to visit our home at your convenience and allow my family to thank you properly. I have recovered quickly and the thanks go to you. Please visit us with your family and let our brief encounter becomes an opportunity to know you more.\nYours truly,\nSimon',

  E'["Dear Mr Ralph,\\nHope you are doing well by the grace of the Almighty. My name is Roger Freddie, who you took care of after an accident last week. And, I am writing this letter to express how grateful I am to you because of saving my life.\\nI am greatly indebted to you because if you were not brave and decisive enough to immediately transport me to the nearest hospital after that big truck had hit my motorbike from behind on that fatal day, I don’t think that I would be alive today to say “thank you” to you. I would also like to say that it is because of Samaritans like you, this world still is a good place to live and still has some hope and goodness left in it.\\nI know that I would never be able to repay you back for the most wonderful charitable deed you did for me, but it would make me feel a little better if you would be kind enough to at least visit my home sometime in the next week and have dinner with my family. Please also bring your family with you, if you like.\\nYours sincerely,\\nRoger Freddie\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 4.59 (11 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nGT Writing Task 1\\nSemi-formal Letter\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\nEtisha\\n4 years 5 months\\nDear Mr Thomas,\\nI hope you and your family are doing well.

Suddenly my car was dashed by from the backside and I lose control over the steering. I was not at all conscious at that time and when I inquired from the hospital I got your details. I am so overwhelmed with your gesture and could not stop myself to write you this note.\\nMy mother wanted to meet you and thank you personally and therefore, we would like to invite you for the dinner at our home and express our gratitude.\\nLooking forward to hearing from you.\\nYours sincerely,\\nEtisha Jain\\nReply\\nQuote\\nKevin\\n5 years\\nDear Bob, I am thankful to you during this Covid Pandemic.\\nReply\\nQuote\\nMohammed\\n6 years 1 month\\nDear Mr Mahmud,\\nMy name is Mohammed Ahmed, and I am originally from Yemen.
