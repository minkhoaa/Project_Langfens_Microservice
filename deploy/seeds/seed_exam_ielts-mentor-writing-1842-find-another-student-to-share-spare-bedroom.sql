  E'["Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI am a resident of your District Sign property, writing to notify you that the central heating system in our house is inadequate and our flat needs some renovation works. I am hoping that you would arrange to fix these issues urgently and let me take a new roommate to reduce the cost.\\nI have been living in one of your houses for the last eight months. I have been sharing this house with two other students. However, we regret to say that the central heating system is ineffectual and this needs an immediate fix as the temperature is below 4 degrees now. Besides, minor dilapidation is visible in some parts of the house and the damp bathroom needs some professional works. I am not sure when was the last time the flat got an inspection from the safety bureau and you should do that promptly. Finally, the house needs a fresh touch of painting.\\nI would like to inform you that we have a spare bedroom that we would like to rent out to a student. The rent we share is a bit expensive. I hope you would not mind if we take an extra person to share the rent.\\nYours faithfully,\\nAlfred Roan", "Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI am Wendy Hall, and I rented a 4-bedroom house six months ago on Corongrill street from your real estate company. I share it with two other students from my college. However, I am writing this letter to discuss a few important issues with you.\\nThe first issue is being that one of the flush tanks of our toilets is leaking, and as a result, the water from the flush tank continuously keeps spreading over the floor of the toilet. No doubt, this is a dangerous situation because some of us may have some accident by slipping on that wet floor. The second issue is that a couple of bulb holders are not working properly. And the last issue is, since you have increased the house rent from the previous month, it has become a bit difficult for only 3 of us to share such a significant amount of rent each month.\\nSo, based on the problems above, I would like to request you to change the flush tank and the bulb holders of our house at your earliest convenience. Besides, it would also be great if you allow us to bring in another student to share the house with us.\\nThank you in advance for your consideration.\\nYours faithfully,\\nWendy Hall\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 4.69 (8 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nGT Writing Task 1\\nFormal Letter\\nComplaints-letter\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\nShalini\\n10 years 2 months\\nPlease give me this type of letter samples.\\nReply\\nQuote\\n×\\nReport\\nReport\\nClose"]'::jsonb,
