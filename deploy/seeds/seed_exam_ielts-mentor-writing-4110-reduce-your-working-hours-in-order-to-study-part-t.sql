  E'["Dear Mr Brook,\\nI am writing this letter to formally request a reduction in my working hours effective from the beginning of the next month. I am requesting this to accommodate my part-time studies, which will start soon. I believe it will enhance both my professional skills and my ability to contribute to the company.\\nI have recently enrolled in a part-time Business Management programme, which aligns closely with my role with this company. This course will equip me with advanced skills in strategic planning, leadership, and data analysis, enabling me to perform my job more effectively. However, to manage my academic commitments, I would like to adjust my working schedule to 9:00 AM to 3:00 PM, Monday to Thursday, and 9:00 AM to 2:00 PM on Friday.\\nI am confident that these studies will allow me to bring fresh perspectives and innovative ideas to my work, ultimately benefiting the company. For the last few months, I have felt the need to better analyse our sales data and I am quite positive that this course will equip me perfectly for this skill.\\nPlease let me know if we can discuss this arrangement further. I truly appreciate your support and consideration.\\nYours sincerely,\\nHenry Whitmore", "Dear Mr Henry,\\nI am writing to request you to reduce my daily working hours so that I can accommodate my part-time studies which are going to begin at the beginning of the next month. I am taking a part-time Cybersecurity course at Hampton Center College, and I am hoping to get your approval to reduce my working hours so that I can continue the course.\\nThe course will begin on the 2nd of March, and the classes and sessions will start at 4:00 pm on weekdays. To continue with the course, which I believe will be a highly beneficial skill for me to contribute to our office, I need to reduce my daily working hours from 8 hours to 5 hours. I wish to start my office at 9:00 am and work till 2:30 pm. The course will take just six months to complete and afterwards, I can resume working for 8 hours a day.\\nAfter I complete this course, I should be able to enhance our ability to protect sensitive data and prevent cyber threats. Since our company heavily rely on digital systems, being able to identify vulnerabilities, implement best practices, and comply with security protocols are immensely important. I want to contribute to safeguarding our company data and protect it from cyber threats.\\nI would kindly request you to reduce my working hours so that I can enrol and successfully complete this course.\\nThank you in advance.\\nYours sincerely,\\nJoshua Carter\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 5.00 (5 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nGT Writing Task 1\\nFormal Letter\\nOfficial-letter\\nLetter Writing Sample\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\nRaymond\\n8 months 3 days\\nDear Mr. Ray,\\nI am writing to request a reduction in my working hours to allow me to focus on the part-time course I have enrolled in. This course is aimed at enhancing my academic knowledge and contributing to the field of information technology (IT) within our organization.\\nI have chosen this part-time course to gain more expertise in data analysis, which I believe will add significant value to our company. I have noticed that we have been incurring substantial expenses hiring external data analysts to analyze our data, and I am confident that by acquiring this skill, I can help save the company a considerable amount of funds.\\nI would like my working schedule to be adjusted to 9:00 AM to 3:00 PM from Monday to Thursday, and 9:00 AM to 2:00 PM on Fridays, effective from May 1, 2025.
