  E'You should spend about\n20\nminutes on this task.\nYou have been working in a company for many years and have noticed that new employees often leave your company.

I am writing to express my concerns in relation to the current scenario of low staff retention in our company, especially with regard to younger and relatively new recruits. I would like to share my ideas to improve the retention rate.\nOne of the main reasons behind this high attrition rate is the lack of opportunities in terms of professional advancement, according to those who left our company during the last two years, which I think should be well taken care of. A team of experts may think of different strategies towards this, which should bring out programs to enhance skills, providing different job titles and look into the promotional aspects for young employees.\nAnother important reason, which one of our employees shared with me at an exit interview, is the dearth of open communication between the management and the workforce, which needs to be improved by providing them with a platform to air their concerns and suggestions, and ensuring that these are well-acted upon. Furthermore, the work-life balance of the employees may be observed closely for betterment.\nFinally, I would like to suggest that appreciation of work on a regular basis can also work magic.\nI look forward to a positive step in this direction to improve employee retention in our company.\nYours faithfully,\nJohn Desuja\n[Written by -\nKe Shi\n]',

I have noticed many employees with less than 3 years of experience quit our company, which has been discussed at our last board meeting. I have been in touch with a few of them and would like to share some insights which might help us improve our young employee retention rate.\\nThe more common reason, I heard from them is the lack of adequate scope for learning with the projects here. They were expected to do the same monotonous work for a long period of time, which didn''t add much to their growth. They often expressed their frustration regarding this.\\nI suggest some Learning Management Systems, which would give an advantage of self-evaluation and can be used to assess the employee''s performance more accurately. I hope you would consider my recommendations, so that we may be able to retain the talented young professionals, who will add more value to the business and to our company. Also by doing this, we can save money and time that we spend on recruiting and training new employees.\\nI look forward to hearing from you regarding this.\\nYours faithfully,\\nChristopher Johnson\\n[", "Dear sir,I am writing this letter in context to the increased retention of employees in our company. As you already know, I have been working in your organization for the past 20 years and want to suggest a possible solution to overcome the above-stated problem. I had talked with various ex-employees and observed various facts why new employees don''t feel part of the organization and after a short span of time, decided to leave the company. After working over a year they feel that there is no further scope of development. Besides, the increment policy of the company is not acceptable to most of the new employees. Moreover, our company does not offer many training sessions that employees find helpful for their growth. In order to overcome these problems, I think there should be a team of 5-6 people in the HR department, who should continuously monitor the problems of an employee and try to fix them on a priority basis. Furthermore, they should organize training sessions on a quarterly basis for all employees and encourage employees to share their ideas with the management. Our review policy should be more transparent and the HR department should notify each employee about the original review with details.
