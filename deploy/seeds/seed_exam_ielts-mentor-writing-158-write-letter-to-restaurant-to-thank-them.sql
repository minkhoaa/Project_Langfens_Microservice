  E'["Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI am writing to express my gratitude for the service you offered on 30th December when I visited your restaurant along with my friends to celebrate my birthday. It was one of the most memorable birthday events in my life and your staff made it even more special by offering a complimentary birthday cake.\\nYou have definitely won me as one of your permanent customers and I would love to recommend your restaurant to my acquaintances. The atmosphere inside the restaurant was very soothing and relaxing. Beautiful interior and wonderful and accurately placed lighting system - neither too bright nor too dim make this place a perfect spot for celebrations. The taste of the food was just out of the world. Allow me to say that you made me nostalgic as the food tasted similar to what my mother cooks for me back at home, though this made me miss my home and mother more!\\nHowever, I have a suggestion to make. You may think of introducing some discount cards or offering some corporate discounts to the people of the nearby area. This, I believe, would make our dine-outs more pocket-friendly.\\nI hope that you will consider this suggestion. Once again, big thanks to you and your staff for making my birthday more distinctive.\\nYours faithfully,\\nPooja Gupta\\n[", "Dear Sir or Madam,\\nLast week, I along with a few of my friends enjoyed a dinner party at your restaurant to celebrate my 21st birthday. I am writing to thank you for the delightful evening that we had.\\nAll my friends thoroughly enjoyed the food and were pleased with the friendly attitude of your staff. We ordered a Chinese menu and it was delicious. We received prompt service and the waiters were quite friendly. They put with well with our bad jokes! The restaurant itself was warm and friendly and the atmosphere showed that all the diners there were enjoying their evening.\\nI believe you have a great place and a small improvement would make it even better. Two of my friends are vegetarian and they felt that the choice for vegetarians was not sufficient. I am hoping you would consider adding a few more items for the vegetarians who would visit your restaurant.\\nOnce again I would like to thank you for making my birthday celebration special and worth enjoying.\\nYours faithfully,\\nKelvin Smith", "Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI am writing to thank you for a fantastic and memorable evening for me and my friends at your restaurant. I would love to see you continue offering such an appreciating dining experience to your guests and wish remarkable success to your business.\\nAs you know, last week I celebrated my 27th birthday with my friends at your restaurant which turned out to be a great success. Everyone enjoyed the arrangement at the poolside and the decoration of sparkling lights with soft and soothing background music. Coming to the food, the presentation was as mouthwatering as the food itself. The service was fabulous too.\\nI am very satisfied with your hospitality. However, I have a suggestion to make. A few friends of mine attended my birthday party with their children. So if you could have added some interesting games for them that would have made the party more interesting. I believe it would be very convenient for other people with children.\\nI once again thank you for your admirable service.\\nYours faithfully,\\nMansoor Afzal\\n[", "Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI am writing to thank you for the fantastic food and service you offered to us on my birthday that we celebrated at your restaurant.

The food was delicious and well-presented. I must mention the “Chicken Tandoori” dish that was served to us was the star of the evening, cooked to perfection and absolutely mind-blowing.\\nI really enjoyed the live music that was being played - it lightened up the whole ambience. I also liked the “Retro Theme” in the restaurant. We were very pleased with the service; all the staff members were friendly, attentive and served us with a smile. Our waiter also made a few recommendations for drinks, which were good and something we enjoyed.\\nI would like to recommend an improvement - as your restaurant is a non-smoking zone, it would be great if you could have a separate smoking area thus smokers will feel more comfortable. I am sure your customers will like this arrangement.\\nThank you once again for making my birthday party memorable. My friends and I enjoyed it thoroughly.\\nI will definitely recommend your restaurant to my friends and family.\\nYours faithfully,\\nAnna Preeti\\n[ by - Preeti]\\nIELTS GT Writing Task 1 / Letter Writing Topic:\\nYou celebrated your birthday with some friends last week in a restaurant.

I am a regular customer to your eatery and last Monday I celebrated my birthday with a few friends and we were utterly pleased with your service and food quality. You have a variety of Italian food that I thoroughly enjoyed with my friends. It is commendable that you always choose the best quality for your ingredients, and we liked the pizza so much especially, Truffle & Spanish pizza, it always melts in my mouth. Moreover, the birthday cake was delicious and we all enjoyed it thoroughly. Furthermore, I would like to mention that your staff members are very amiable and professional. They served us with a smile and they were prompt. You also have the most elegant decoration, with light & faint music, the ambient interior was so soothing and comfortable. I would like to suggest that you should enlarge your restaurant because it is small and with the popularity of it, it sometimes becomes crowded. The additional space would allow more guests and that would be good for your business.
