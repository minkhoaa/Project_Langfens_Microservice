  E'["Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI am one of your loyal customers and I always take your service for any computer repair works. However, this time I am writing to complain about a poor customer service that I received on 20th September from your shop. I really am disappointed with the service and I hope you will take prompt action after investigating the letter.\\nA few days ago my computer showed some anomalies and every few hours, it got restarted automatically. In fact, I didn’t pay much attention to this issue until the problem became more frequent. So, I took my computer to your store on 15th September and your customer care officer promised to fix the problem in a day or two. However, he took a week to call me and when I brought my computer home, I found that nothing has been done. The restarting problem reappeared as usual while I paid $100 to your shop and waited for one week to have it fixed.\\nThis is a frustrating and daunting experience that I have had with your service and I would ask you to investigate the reason for this poor customer support. Please send someone to my home to have the issue fixed or refund the service charge that I have already paid for apparently nothing.\\nI am looking forward to hearing from you soon.\\nYours faithfully,\\nMilad Rahimi\\n[", "Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI took my computer to your service centre on 22nd July and was charged £80 for repair work. However, I had to go to your shop twice and I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with the service I received from a particular technician.\\nI purchased the computer last year and the warranty expired only a month ago. For the last few days, I was having problems with my computer. Some programs froze frequently and sometimes I had to restart the computer for that. I took my computer to your store on 22nd July and tried to explain the problem to a technician, who introduced himself as Michel, but he was very rude and pointed me that the computer is working fine. I tried to convince him to spend more time to identify the problem, but he acted arrogantly and impatiently explained to me that his shift is over and I will have to come the next working day.\\nAs a regular customer and since I wanted to have my computer fixed promptly, the next day, I travelled to your shop again. This time another technician, John Bolt, listened to me attentively and spent some time with the computer. He fixed my computer in less than an hour.\\nI suppose your employee Michel is not proper for his position because of his unprofessionalism. Please employ more skilled and cordial technicians who do behave rudely.\\nYours faithfully,\\nStuart Albert", "Dear Sir or Madam,\\nRecently I took my computer to your store and had it repaired for a charge of $100. However, I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with the service that I experienced at your store. I am hoping that you would take action to improve your service quality and give me an explanation of the unexpected event.\\nWith regards to the poor customer service, one of your staff, whose name I cannot recall, promised me on 25th June that the repair work would take only two days as the computer had a minor problem. When I expressed concern about my data, he assured me that it would not be affected in any way. Three days later, I received a call from your store and was told that the repair will take longer than expected, so I had to wait a bit longer.\\nAfter nine days, I finally brought my computer home. To my dismay, some of my important data and files were gone. Given what I was told previously, I was extremely disappointed and upset. Honestly, I did not expect such terrible service from your store. I demand that you give me a proper explanation as to how this incident occurred. You must also restore my missing data.\\nI look forward to hearing from you soon.\\nYours faithfully,\\nHelen Lim\\n[", "Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI have recently taken your PC repairing service but my experience was dismaying. I am hoping that you would take the necessary actions to improve your service quality and arrange for my computer to be properly fixed this time.\\nMy computer had some problems including slow startup and sudden blue screen and to have those issues resolved, I took it to your repair shop on 18th March. I got a call on 22nd May from your store and your staff claimed that the issues were tackled. They charged me $95 and I took my computer home that evening. Unfortunately, those problems were not properly fixed as they reappeared. I work from home and have important projects on hand. Your poor service has wasted my time, money and put me in a difficult situation to handle project deadlines.\\nAs a regular customer and since I have already paid my service charge, I need my computer fixed by tomorrow. So, please make arrangements to repair it by your personnel as soon as possible.\\nI am looking forward to hearing from you at your earliest.\\nYours faithfully,\\nAli Hosseini\\n[", "Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI am a regular customer of your store and have found all my interactions with your office very satisfactory. But, I am sorry to say that the service I received last week, to have my personal computer repaired, was not as per your excellence. I am hoping that you would rectify the issue to keep your reputation intact.\\nFirst of all, the front desk technician was not available at the time of our prescheduled appointment. I had to wait 45 minutes for him to appear. However, this was just the beginning of the poor service I experience yesterday. He did not seem to have enough understanding of the computer hardware and Linux operating system and it took me 30 minutes to explain the problem and then he accepted my computer for the warranty. On 19th November, when I collected my computer, I noticed that the invoice includes the cost of the keypad replacement! I never lodged a request to change the keyboard!\\nI request you to look into this matter and remove the keyboard replacement charge from the invoice. Also, appoint technically sound personnel to your service team as they represent your company.\\nI am looking forward to hearing from you soon.\\nYours faithfully,\\nRamanuj Sharma\\n[", "Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI took my computer to your repair shop recently and I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with the repair work your technician did on my computer’s heatsink. I suggest they should properly diagnose the problems before fixing any computer and charging money to a customer.\\nI took my computer to your store on 07th December because of an overheating issue with it. After careful inspections, one of your technicians determined the problem to be an old heatsink that could no longer keep the processor cool. I was told that the problem will be fixed and that my computer will no longer heat up. I paid $80 for the repair work and another $35 for a new heatsink.\\nHowever, when I brought the computer home, the problem still persisted, and my computer was heating up even more than before. You can understand my shock when I realised that I travelled 10 miles and paid your store $115 for nothing.\\nMy intention in writing this letter is to ask you to install a brand new heatsink- that can keep the processor cool, at no extra charge. I can come by and bring my computer on Monday morning if it suits you.\\nI look forward to hearing from you soon.\\nYours faithfully,\\nSameed Qureshi\\n["]'::jsonb,
