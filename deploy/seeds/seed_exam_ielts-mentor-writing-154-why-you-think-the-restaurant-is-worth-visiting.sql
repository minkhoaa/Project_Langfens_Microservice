  E'["Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI am writing to share my positive review for the Yummy Restaurant that I believe is a worth visiting dining establishment in our area.\\nWe celebrated my sister''s birthday party last week at this restaurant. Originally, I thought only twenty people would attend, but apparently, the number increased to thirty. I was worried that it would not be possible for the restaurant to accommodate more people without prior notice. However, I was pleasantly surprised when the Manager told me that they could do it and would even upgrade our room to a more spacious one. The overall service was impeccable and the party was a hit, thanks to the great staff and their professionalism.\\nWe ordered a three-course set menu and the taste was top-notch. The escargot entree was absolutely divine that I could still remember the taste of its garlic butter sauce. My sister ordered pan-fried salmon fillet with mashed potatoes as the main course, and people were raving about it. The dessert was a mini-opera which I thought to be rather average, though it might be simply because I do not have sweet teeth.\\nOverall, we experienced a wonderful night at this restaurant. This place is highly recommended and we have even started planning our next visit. I believe you should publish an article regarding this establishment in your ''Fine diners'' section so that people can learn about this fabulous place.\\nThank you in advance.\\nYours faithfully,\\nHelen Lim", "Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI am a resident in the Teraleus community and a photojournalist by profession. I am writing a recommendation to other citizens, which I believe you would publish in your newspaper, for one of our fine neighbourhood dining establishments - The Diners'' Heart.\\nI had been to this establishment twice last month, and I absolutely love their food, professionalism, decor and behaviours. The décor, free parking, and friendly staffs are something a guest would notice even before he tastes the food. I particularly enjoyed their variety of dishes including exotic ones. But, it was the service, along with the size and quality of the portions, that was most memorable. I must mention that they offer a great price.\\nThe service was professional yet intimate, and along with the sheer quantity of the dishes served, their great price motivated me to pass on my recommendation. I enjoyed their fried rice, and a giant fresh, crisp salad accompanied by a selection of appropriately selected seasonal vegetables and a fish curry. I finally enjoyed their fabulous dessert item - and all for a reasonable price.\\nI hope you would help others know about this establishment so that they can enjoy the delicious food and have family parties at a great place.\\nYours faithfully,\\nWilson Miller", "Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI am a resident of Panadura city in Kaluthara district and writing to express my enthusiasm regarding a restaurant that I visited with my family last week. I believe this is a magnificent place for diners and would like you to publish a review on it so that others in our community can learn about it\\nI have visited the establishment - The River View, with my family to enjoy dinner last Sunday. The surrounding view is wonderful and it was decorated gorgeously. The decoration and ambience of the place were mesmerising, not to mention the well-behaved staff. We ordered fried rice, chicken curry, Parata and Lunumiris and I personally felt that they had a wide range of dishes we could choose from. We were served very quickly and the food tasted celestial.  Normally, I don''t each much at night, but on that day I had a heavy meal! They offered us a 15% discount and a complimentary dessert.\\nAll of my family members appreciated the dining experience and mentioned the scrumptious menu they enjoyed. They thanked me for taking them to a great eatery.\\nThis letter is to inform about this restaurant to the mass people because it is a worth visiting place.\\nYours faithfully,\\nAshesha Weerasinghe\\nIELTS GT Writing Task 1 / Letter Writing Topic:\\nYou had a good meal at a local restaurant with your family. Write a letter to the newspaper to tell them about it, describe the meal you had, and why you think the restaurant is worth visiting.\\nWrite at least\\n150\\nwords.", "Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI am writing to draw your attention to a local restaurant that provides wonderful services to its customers and I request you to publish a review of this restaurant in the ‘Food and Life’ section of your famous daily to let people know about it.\\nRecently, I took my family to dine out at a local restaurant named Golden Spoon at Lalmatia, Mohammadpur. The restaurant mainly serves Chinese and Thai food, although they have arrangements for continental dishes. It is a two-storied building with a rooftop and has ample space for car parking in front of the restaurant. The restaurant is decorated with paintings and soft lightings, and wonderful wooden furniture. We were stunned by the music being played at a low volume to add pleasure to the guests. It has a playground for children on the first floor. We were also delighted at their warm reception and reasonable price.\\nDuring our last visit, I ordered Thai soup, chicken fry, rice with beef and prawn, and vegetable salad. The food was so fresh and delicious that we ate more than usual. The waiters gave us a great service and we were offered a 10% complimentary discount.\\nI believe this restaurant is worth visiting for the food lovers who like to taste different dishes and want the best return on their money. I am hoping you would write a review on this establishment so that more people can know about it.\\nYours faithfully,\\nEnamul Kabir\\n[", "Dear sir or Madam,\\nI am a resident of central Seoul city, South Korea. I am writing to recommend one of the best restaurants I have been to lately. I hope you would write a review of this establishment for more people to learn about this great establishment.\\nIt was my birthday and we visited a Korean restaurant on Friday in my town. Personally, I did not expect anything special about it because my originally booked Italian restaurant was cancelled due to some unavoidable reasons. I was feeling a bit gloomy but the Korean restaurant''s ambient presence and warm welcome revived my mood. We ordered BBQ and ice-noodles and they served not only an incredibly delicious meal but also offered us the best possible service.\\nMoreover, the restaurant''s manager told that most of the ingredients came from organic farms. The noodles tasted celestial and the BBQ was perfectly grilled. The restaurant was a wonderful choice for the celebration on top of its great location.\\nI am convinced that people would love to be there and would find it a pocket-friendly restaurant that serves highly palatable food. It would be a good idea if you recommended the restaurant in your newspaper.\\nYours faithfully,\\nJack Seojun\\n["]'::jsonb,
