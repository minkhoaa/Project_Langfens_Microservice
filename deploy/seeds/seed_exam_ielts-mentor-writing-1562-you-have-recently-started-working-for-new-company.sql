  E'["Dear Kathy,\\nHope you are doing well. It''s been a long since we have last met. I am writing to let you know that I have recently changed my job and I really like it. I hope we would be able to meet soon and spend some exciting time together.\\nThough I was professionally satisfied with my previous job, it was hard for me to balance my professional and personal life. Long working hours were not allowing me to get some time for myself. Moreover, I was looking for an opportunity that would allow me to grow in the people management area along with technical skills. The new company offers both. I am responsible for the project delivery and I lead a team of eight people. I am truly excited about this new role.\\nI would also like to inform you that I have finally purchased a car. It is a second-hand car, however, it is in good condition. I enjoy a daily drive to work. No more today. Please convey my regards to your family.\\nI look forward to knowing what you are doing these days. Please write me back at your convenience.\\nWarm wishes,\\nNaaz\\n[", "Dear Jane,\\nHope you''re doing well. It''s been so long since I''ve heard from you. I was thinking of you the other day when I saw my neighbour''s garden full of tulips. I am sure you are still a passionate gardener. You would be glad to hear that I have recently taken a job and moved to Ottawa, Canada.\\nAs you know, I was eagerly looking forward to settling in Ottowa with my family. So when I got a job offer from one of the prestigious hospitals in Ottawa, I accepted it. I liked my previous job in Ontario but had been stuck in the same position for a long and was not getting many chances to further my career. That''s why I changed my job and so far I find my new responsibilities exciting. I am a general physician at the hospital and I have to look after the visiting patients to diagnose and suggest treatment of illnesses. Sometimes I need to do some minor surgery.\\nI must say that this place is absolutely amazing and the people are friendly, kind and accommodating. Aside from that, Ottawa is celebrating Tulip Festival annually in May, during the springtime. I know your passion for tulips and gardening. I bet you would definitely like it here.\\nSo far, I’m enjoying my life here and all the new experiences. I hope you could visit us soon. How are things back home in the United Kingdom?\\nI am eagerly waiting to hear from you soon.\\nWarm wishes,\\nEva\\n[ by - Jim Bryan ]\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 4.72 (16 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nGT Writing Task 1\\nInformal Letter\\nPersonal Letter\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\n×\\nReport\\nReport\\nClose"]'::jsonb,
