  E'["Dear Mr Smith,\\nI am writing this letter in connection with the non-functional heating system in your house where we currently reside in. The heating system is not working for more than a week and a team of men came to fix it but could not do anything. I am hoping you would call another expert team to have it fixed immediately.\\nI am a student at the Cherry Blossom school in Brighton and have been residing in your flat with three other roommates for the last eleven months. As per our rental agreement, we reported the issue to your designated workmen first. However, they have failed to fix the problem and have exacerbated the situation by drilling some holes in the bathroom wall, channels and the cold air freeze us in this intense winter.\\nDue to the non-functional heating system, we are unable to control water temperature, and we are compelled to heat water using gas burners for our daily domestic use. Similarly, we can''t control the room temperature and we are living with thick winter clothes donned on our bodies round the clock. This is highly unpleasant and obnoxious to all of us.\\nIn order to fix the issue, once and for all, I suggest engaging a better maintenance service agency with more skilled professionals than your current workmen. You can find many such agencies in a newspaper''s classified section.\\nConsidering the severity of the issue, I expect your immediate action.\\nYours sincerely,\\nJonathan Aflex", "Dear Mrs Thompson,\\nI am writing this letter to notify you of the heating problem in our rented apartment. I as well well as my flatmates are having a hard time coping with the extreme winter and hoping that you would have the problem resolved immediately.\\nI am Niro, a second-year student at the Pedagogy English Medium School in Brighton. I along with two other students, rented your apartment on the park road last February. Overall, we are happy with our accommodation.\\nUnfortunately, the central heating system stopped working a week ago and we do not have any hot water in our flat. Two repairmen visited our flat last Friday and tried to fix the heater, but without any result. We are suffering to a great extent due to this and the winter is almost unbearable without the heating system and hot water.\\nI hope you can understand our problem and take action immediately. I suggest fixing an auto heater to the bathroom and replacing the current one. If we do not get a proper solution within a week, we would be forced to vacate your flat.\\nKindly resolve this problem as soon as possible and oblige us.\\nThank you in advance.\\nYours sincerely,\\nNiro Maala\\n[ by -\\nNiro\\n]\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 5.00 (7 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nGT Writing Task 1\\nSemi-formal Letter\\nComplaints-letter\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\n×\\nReport\\nReport\\nClose"]'::jsonb,
