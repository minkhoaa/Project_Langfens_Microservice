I am originally from Brazil and my student ID number is S2-5487. I would like to request you to arrange suitable accommodation for me in the college hostel as my current housing arrangement is utterly inconvenient and rather expensive.\\nI came to the UK last year and have stayed with a relative for around six months before moving to a private accommodation with a Russian family. I applied for a hostel room to the college authority before moving to the private accommodation but did not get one as a fresher, which I guess is no longer applicable to me.\\nRegrettably, I am having unendurable inconveniences at my current residing arrangement. The traffic kills more than 3 hours per day and I can barely manage my time to study for the exams. The family I live with has frequent guests and parties. I have little privacy there and would like to be near the college to save the time spent on the road. Moreover, being at the heart of the college would allow me to have better interactions with teachers and my classmates. Finally, this would be more pocket-friendly for me.\\nI, hereby, request you to allow me a single room at the college hostel as soon as possible. I would be much obliged.\\nYours faithfully,\\nLucas Libra\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 4.82 (11 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nGT Writing Task 1\\nFormal Letter\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\nNeha Sharma\\n7 years 9 months\\nDear Sir, I am writing this letter to inquire the availability of a room to live in at the college hostel. I am a first-year student at the University of Edinburgh; therefore, I am eligible to apply for the university accommodation. My current accommodation arrangement has some problems and that''s why I have decided to move. At present, I am living in a shared apartment in the suburb area, around 30 miles away from the university. Long distance is the primary reason I have made my mind to shift to the university accommodation. My roommates are very inconsiderate and play loud music, have frequent parties, just a few to mention, and I am fed up with their irrational behaviours.I must mention, the college accommodation would not only save my time but also money because it takes me an hour to commute to University and costs me $10 each day. Additionally, I would be able to get rid of my current roommates. Since I will be living with students, I will enjoy the opportunity to discuss coursework with them. In another word, I can have a perfect study environment. Looking for your positive response.Yours faithfully.Neha\\nReply\\nQuote\\nNobin\\n7 years 10 months\\nDear Sir, I am Jack Robinson, a second-year BSc student in your esteemed institution. I request you to arrange me an accommodation in the college hostel. Currently, I am staying in a rented apartment with other flatmates. I am not at all comfortable with my current accommodation arrangement. All other members of the flat are job-holders and I am the only student there. They return in the evening and have parties often. Some of them watch TV with a loud volume. So I am not getting a proper environment for my studies. I will prefer to stay at the college lodging to get a nice atmosphere for study. As far as I know, our college lodging has a timetable which all pupils must follow and that is exactly what I am looking forward to. Having classmates and seniors around would be a great help. Our college hostel has a good canteen and I will get nutritious and tasty food. I will be more disciplined in my life. So kindly allow me to move to the college hostel as soon as possible. Your’s faithfully,Jack Robinson\\nReply\\nQuote\\nNishita Kulkarni\\n7 years 10 months\\nThanks for the nice", ", \\"...coat me a huge money ...\\" should read \\"...quote me a huge amount of money ...\\". :sigh: Thank you,Nishita Kulkarni\\nReply\\nQuote\\n×\\nReport\\nReport\\nClose"]'::jsonb,
