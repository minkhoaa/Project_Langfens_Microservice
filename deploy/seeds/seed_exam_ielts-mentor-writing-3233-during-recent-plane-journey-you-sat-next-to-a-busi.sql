  E'["Dear Mr Barron,\\nI am Robert Caldwell, who sat next to you on a flight from Brisbane to London on September 18th. You offered me your business card after hearing about my enthusiasm to work in a restaurant. I am writing regarding my keen interest to work in one of your restaurants as an assistant manager.\\nIt was very kind of you to advise me that I should contact you if I ever want to work in a restaurant. As I mentioned briefly during our delightful conversation, I used to work at a restaurant as an assistant manager and took a break from work to complete my Master''s degree. Now that I am willing to work again, I would like you to consider me as a potential employee in one of your restaurants in Australia - perhaps as an assistant manager.\\nI have worked as an assistant manager in a reputed restaurant in Melbourne for about 3 years, and before that, I was in charge of the customer care department in a retail shop. I have completed a course in hotel management from one of the top management schools in Australia. I am positive that my skills and expertise will be useful to your organisation.\\nIf you have any queries, please contact me at the email address or phone number provided on my Curriculum Vitae.\\nYours sincerely,\\nRobert Caldwell", "Dear Mr. Adam,\\nI am Owen Clarke, writing to follow up on our conversation during our flight from Toronto to New York on 12th March. We had a pleasant discussion about the hospitality industry, and you mentioned how your restaurants and hotels have been serving many locals and tourists in Toronto for the last five years. During our conversation, you kindly suggested that I contact you regarding potential job opportunities at one of your restaurants.\\nI am particularly interested in a restaurant management position within your chain. With five years of experience in the hospitality sector, including my recent role as an assistant manager at a fine-dining restaurant, I have developed strong skills in team leadership, customer service, and business operations. I am passionate about delivering exceptional dining experiences and ensuring seamless restaurant management.\\nGiven my experience and enthusiasm for the industry, I believe I would be a valuable addition to your team. I would love the opportunity to discuss this further at your convenience. Please let me know a suitable time for a meeting.\\nYours sincerely,\\nOwen Clarke", "Dear Mr Reynold,\\nI am Paul Strang, and I am lucky enough to have been introduced to you just a few days ago. Not sure if you will remember me, but I had an opportunity to talk with you about two weeks ago when we both were travelling by air from Boston to Dallas.\\nI was sitting next to you, and after we got introduced, we had some interesting conversations. You were kind enough to suggest to me that I should contact you for a possible job position at one of your restaurants. So, here I am, sir, as I would like to apply for a managerial position at your restaurant.\\nI think that I would be a very suitable candidate for the managerial position in one of your restaurants because I have already worked as an Assistant Human Resource and Payroll Manager for a large and busy residential hotel in my hometown. I have learned a great deal about customers’ needs in the service industry. Besides, I also have a post-graduate diploma in human resource management.\\nSo, based on my credentials and experience, I think, I should be able to render excellent service to your company. I would very much like to work for your company. I am hoping that you would give me an opportunity to prove my worth.\\nYours sincerely,\\nPaul Strang\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 4.56 (24 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nGT Writing Task 1\\nSemi-formal Letter\\nLetter Writing Sample\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\nSara\\n6 years 1 month\\nDear Mr Peterson,\\nMy name is Mark Arnold - as you might remember me from our meeting on a flight from London to Toronto last Thursday. I was sitting next to you, and we had a brilliant conversation the whole time. You offered me a job in one of your fancy restaurants in Canada.\\nI would be really grateful if I had the opportunity to work as a qualified chef at one of your restaurants. I have finished a three years study programme in cookery and food hygiene, and I have two years of work experience in one of the well-known restaurants in my hometown in Kuala Lumpur.\\nI am really passionate about cooking and my special area of expertise is in food art and cake decorating. In my hometown, I have made over a few hundred birthday and wedding cakes which were all appreciated by customers. During our conversation, you mentioned that each of your restaurants has a special area where parties are frequently organised. So I think I can be a valuable asset to your business.\\nI have a special Facebook page called \\"cake decorated\\" where I upload my work regularly. You can check it if you like. And I would really appreciate your commendable decision to offer me a job.\\nYours sincerely,\\nMark Arnold\\nReply\\nQuote\\nSunil\\n6 years 2 months\\nDear Mr Smith,\\nMy name is Sunil and we met last week on a SpiceJet flight from Hyderabad to Delhi. I was sitting next to you on the flight and after we got introduced, we had a brief discussion about my work experience, and you suggested a possible job opening in one of your restaurants.\\nI would like to offer my candidacy as an accountant in your restaurant and I believe I can serve the possible with dedication.
