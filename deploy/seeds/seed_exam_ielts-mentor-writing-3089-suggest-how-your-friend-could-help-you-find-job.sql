  E'["Dear Thomas,\\nI hope you are doing great. I''m excited to let you know that I''ll be moving to Toronto next month to pursue my Master’s degree in Computer Science at the University of Toronto. Since you have been living in Canada for a while now, I was hoping you could help me find a part-time job while I study.\\nThe main reason I want to work part-time is to gain international work experience and improve my English communication skills. Additionally, a part-time job would help me cover some of my living expenses, making my stay in Canada more manageable. Given my background in software development, I would love to find a job related to IT, such as a tech support role, web development, or even tutoring in programming. However, I am also open to other opportunities.\\nSince you are familiar with the local job market, could you suggest where I should start my job search? If you know of any openings or can introduce me to someone who is hiring, that would be really helpful.\\nLooking forward to catching up soon!\\nBest regards,\\nLi Wei", "Dear Marcus,\\nHope you and your family are doing great. I have got admitted to the Queen Mary University of London for my MSc in Accounting and Finance. This is a full-time course and hopefully, I will fly to London next month. To support my tuition fee and get some work experience, I am planning to get a part-time job and I am hoping that you can help me find a suitable one.\\nMy class will begin on 2nd November and I will arrive in the UK on 24th October. I want to pursue a career in the financial service industry in my home country and want to take advantage of the contemporary and specialised approach to accountancy and finance that this course offers. The worlds of accountancy and finance are always changing due to the changing legal framework the financial sector operates in. This is why I have decided to enrol in this course. I plan to finish it on time and learn as much as possible.\\nTo assist in covering my tuition fee and get some job experience, I intend to do a part-time job, specifically in an accounting firm. Hope my Bsc in Accounting would be helpful for that. I hardly know anyone in the UK except you and I know that you have a wide social network in London that you can use to manage a job for me. I have forwarded my Curriculum Vitae to your email and I am expecting that you can manage a part-time job before I arrive in London. I would be indebted for your support.\\nI look forward to hearing from you soon. Take care and stay fine.\\nBest wishes,\\nStacy", "Dear Annie,\\nHope you are doing fine. My departure date for New Zealand is drawing near, and I am busy with last-minute preparations. As you know, I have enrolled at an institute called ''Practical English'' in Wellington, for a six-month Advanced course, full-time. It is quite expensive but I am hopeful of improving my English skills, especially pronunciation.\\nTo assist in covering the costs of my study, I aim to find a part-time job. Not only are the college fees rather high, but also I know that rental accommodation in the capital city will not be cheap; to say nothing of food and heating expenses! So I would very much like to arrange some temporary employment before I arrive.\\nI was wondering if you could ask around among your friends and colleagues to see if anyone wants a house cleaner, gardener, or nanny for their children. I know you have a wide social network in Wellington which you could canvas for me if you wouldn''t mind, I''d be so grateful.\\nI look forward to seeing you soon.\\nBest wishes,\\nJuliana\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 4.95 (10 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nGT Writing Task 1\\nInformal Letter\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\nSabrina Qamar\\n7 years 5 months\\nDear Mark,\\nHope you''re doing fine. I''m delighted to inform you that I''ve got admitted to a degree programme at Queens College London, and I''ll be joining the course from next month. I''m wondering if I can get a part-time job before my arrival there and whether you can help me with that.\\nI looked at some job portals but looks like I need your guidance to land a job. As you know, I''ve graduated in architecture and need a job in that field. This job will definitely give me some financial assistance during my studies. You have been there for many years so I believe you have a wide circle of people who you can talk to about a possible job vacancy. It would be great if you suggest some of the offices with part-time architect requirements. I will be glad to apply there.\\nHope you''ll understand my situation.\\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\\nYours truly,\\nJimmy\\nReply\\nQuote\\nSateesh\\n3 years 11 months\\nDear Sumanth,\\nHow are you? I hope you are doing good. You''d be happy to learn that I am coming to the USA for my Master’s degree course in computer science at the University of North Carolina. It’s a one and a half years'' course and divided into 4 semesters. After my classes, I am planning to get involved in some kind of part-time job. Hope you''d be able to help me with that.\\nI have only five classes per week, so am planning to do a part-time job during my free time. It would allow me to earn some money as well as gain valuable work experience. I very much want to learn about the American way of life and work ethics. So getting a job would be a bonus for me. My father is going to retire from his job soon. So I''d like to become economically self-reliant soon.\\nI don''t know exactly how I can get a part-time job easily there and what kind of jobs I can do besides studying. Can you please check out what kind of jobs are available and if there is any previous experience/training required to get those jobs?\\nPlease collect the information and send it as soon as possible so that I get prepared before I move to the USA.\\nThanks in advance.\\nYours truly,\\nSateesh\\nReply\\nQuote\\n×\\nReport\\nReport\\nClose"]'::jsonb,
