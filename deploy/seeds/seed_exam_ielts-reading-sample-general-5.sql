    E'# Passage\n\nGeneral Reading Passage 15 - 1\nSome places to visit\nA.\nBeautiful\nKingsley House\nwas built \n	in the 18th century, and all the rooms are decorated and furnished in the style \n	of the time. They include the dining room, study and dressing room, which contains \n	a display of 18th-century ladies’ clothing. Our volunteer guides in each room \n	bring the house to life with stories of the past.\nB.\nThe\nAfrica Museum\nwas founded \n	50 years ago, and to commemorate the event, we have chosen 50 treasures from \n	the permanent collection and put them together to tell the fascinating story \n	of that continent. This exhibition continues until the end of the year. The \n	Folk Art Gallery opens to the public next month, exhibiting traditional paintings \n	and other objects from all over Africa.\nC.\nFrom the outside,\n17 Mansfield \n	Street\nmay not look particularly exciting, but come inside, and you''ll find \n	yourself in a historic building that started life as a theatre, before becoming \n	a bank and then a restaurant, which is still in operation. On Sundays and Mondays, \n	when the restaurant is closed, a guide is available to show you round the building \n	and its fascinating architectural features.\nD.\nThe\nIndustrial Heritage Centre\ntells the fascinating story of a local family firm. Mr John Carroll started \n	his engineering business in this building exactly 150 years ago. The firm closed \n	in 1969, but the factory has been re-created, with machines like those that \n	Mr Carroll was familiar with. See what working life could be like in the 19th \n	century, a life far removed from the elegance of the wealthy.\nE.\nThe\nFashion Museum\nhas only just \n	opened. It is home to an outstanding collection of more than 30,000 objects \n	worn by men, women and children, dating from the 17th century to the present \n	day. You''ll see how people used to dress! As well as the permanent exhibits, \n	you can currently see\nDressing the Stars\n, which displays original costumes worn \n	by the stars of many popular films.\nF.\nHaving spent the best part of \n	two years being refurbished, the\nMason Museum\nhas recently opened its doors \n	again. It provides a magnificent setting for its art collection and for the \n	beautiful 18th-century furniture for which the Mason is famous. Open Mondays \n	to Fridays 10-4, and weekends 10-6.\n\n.'
