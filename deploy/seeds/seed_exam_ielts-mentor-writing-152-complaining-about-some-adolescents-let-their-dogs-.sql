  E'["Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI am writing this letter to complain about a severe condition in my neighbourhood created by some teenagers who make the life of ordinary citizens difficult especially by letting their dangerous dogs roam freely in the streets.\\nI have been residing in this town for the last five years. It was a peaceful locality up until recently. The situation deteriorated, perhaps because some new families settled in here lately who have teenage children who they have no control over. These youngsters all have untrained bulldogs who accompany them all the time. The cause of concern is that they often let the dogs go free and run behind them as if they are competing. This creates fear and terror among other well-disposed residents. On the contrary, they misbehave with the elderly and use offensive words in the open streets.\\nIn this worrisome and tense situation, I would expect you to take proper actions to restore the peacefulness in the neighbourhood. This would be a sigh of relief for all residents.\\nI sincerely hope that you would take immediate actions against all those involved in creating havoc in this peaceful community.\\nYours faithfully,\\nMubashir Noorani\\n[", "Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI am writing this letter to draw your attention to a situation that has been developing in my neighbourhood - some teenagers have dogs on the loose. I am hoping you would take the necessary action before somebody gets hurt or injured.\\nRecently, I have witnessed that a few adolescences own dogs who are on the loose in the neighbourhood. These dogs, many of which are fierce-looking and not muzzled, run around the neighbourhood. The boys who accompany these dogs are mostly between 11-16 years old and do not care about the situation. Many freely run dogs are intimidating, especially to children and the elderly. I am afraid that it’s just a matter of time before someone gets seriously injured.\\nThe owners of these dogs, a bunch of adolescents, seem to be unaware of the dangers of letting their pets off the leash and have adopted a nonchalant attitude. The teenagers have been asked by numerous locals to keep the dogs under control but all requests have been ignored.\\nI, therefore, believe that immediate action must be taken and I ask that you investigate the matter and take appropriate action as soon as possible to prevent the occurrence of injury and serious bodily harm.\\nYours faithfully,\\nCarol Diana", "Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI am a resident of Block ‘D’ of the housing society in Oregon, writing this letter to notify you of a certain callous attitude of some young children. I am hoping you would take immediate action to curb the problem.\\nBy virtue of this letter, it is to bring to your attention that certain adolescents who reside in our society are creating a dangerous situation by letting their dogs run wildly throughout society. These dogs are on the loose and not muzzled. Children are in constant fear about the threat of a possible confrontation with a dog. Moreover, it is difficult for elderly residents to have an evening stroll in the park due to the same fear.\\nIn view of this, it is my humble request to issue a letter, through the medium of your office, to make the parents of such adolescents aware of the grim situation. Only a few teenagers irresponsible and careless behaviour and attitude are causing big trouble.\\nI hope you would take proper action before a serious incident takes place.\\nYours faithfully,\\nNeeraj Mehra", "Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI am writing this letter in order to bring your attention to an important issue which our neighbourhood is currently facing.\\nFor quite some time, we have been noticing with great concern that some young boys of about 12 to 15 years of age from our area are allowing their dogs to run wildly in our neighbourhood. Initially, it was not a matter of big concern, but slowly and slowly, this is becoming dangerous as the dogs are frequently coming into contact with the community members, which is not safe.\\nIn fact, the situation has become so dangerous and scary for some of our good neighbours that they are even afraid to come out of their homes sometimes because of these freely-roaming dogs. Some of the members of our community have already talked to the parents of these boys, but, unfortunately, the situation has not exactly changed much in our favour.\\nIn view of this dangerous situation, which is prevailing in our neighbourhood, I would like you to please take some necessary steps to bring these adolescent boys and their dogs under control before some serious accidents take place.\\nYours faithfully,\\nJon Garson\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 4.64 (14 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nGT Writing Task 1\\nFormal Letter\\nComplaints-letter\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\nShub\\n8 years 8 months\\nLetter/ GT writing task 1 Topic:Write a letter to complain about a situation in which some adolescents let their dogs run wildly causing a dangerous situation.Answer: Dear sir,I am writing this letter to complain about the dogs in our neighbourhood which are owned and controlled by some very young boys and can cause hazardous situations as these dogs are not controlled properly. It might create perilous situations for those around - knowingly or unknowingly. I have experienced that some teenagers are letting their dogs move out freely in our area and they are unaware of the danger of this. We had witnessed a fatal incident yesterday as a dog bit a child in the morning whilst he was trying to play with the dog. Post investigation revealed that no immunisation was done to the dog, thus it could have resulted in the life of that child. Though necessary precaution was taken, but why we should allow such situation to occur? There should be some mandatory regulations which would be in the favour of surrounding people and impose strict actions against the careless owners of dogs. The more daunting issue is that some teenagers often own dogs for show off, do not care to vaccinate those dogs and let them run wildly. Seems like they do no know or care about the severity of the situation it can turn up to. Anticipating your response and support very urgently.
