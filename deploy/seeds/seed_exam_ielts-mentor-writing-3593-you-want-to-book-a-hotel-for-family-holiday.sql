  E'["Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI am writing this letter to you because your hotel was recommended to me for the holidays of my family by one of my close friends who has visited your hotel a month ago.  I am hoping to get some information so that I can book our stay there.\\nMy friend, who has recommended the hotel to me, told me a lot of good things about your hotel, especially about the quality of service and price that are offered.  But, as far as I am concerned, I would prefer a large suite of at least two rooms that can comfortably accommodate me, my husband, my mother and two of my teenage children.\\nI am planning to visit during the weekend, and I also understand that the price is a little higher during that time.  However, while I am not too much concerned about the price of the hotel, I would certainly appreciate it if you could tell me about the services and amenities – such as Wi-Fi internet service and airport shuttle service - that come with it.  Besides, information regarding what kind of activities we can enjoy there, as well as what kinds of interesting places are there to visit nearby - would also be highly appreciated.\\nYours faithfully,\\nEmily Blunt\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 3.66 (16 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nGT Writing Task 1\\nFormal Letter\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\nSuxrobjon\\n2 years 1 month\\nIt is very useful. Thank you.\\nReply\\nQuote\\nDiloromxon\\n2 years 2 months\\nDear Sir or Madam,\\nI am writing to you to book a room for my family for an upcoming holiday as a friend of mine recommended your hotel recently.\\nI would like to take the accommodation that has 3 big rooms with at least two balconies. We also want the windows facing rooms to the seashore. I heard that your hotel is a skyscraper and I would be so happy if you could locate us somewhere no upper than the 3rd floor. When it comes to the date we are going to visit is on May 25, right after my children can have their summer vacation. It is going to be around after 2 weeks.\\nWe are planning to stay around a week in your hotel and I am wondering if I can get information about the services that will be included in the price of our stay. The means of transportation we will use to get there is a plane so I will probably ask for you to send a taxi to get us to your hotel. Besides, my friend told me how he enjoyed having hotel services.\\nI am also interested in what type of entertaining spots are available for the visitors because it is going to be our first family travel to your city and my children are really excited about that. They will definitely ask me to get them around.\\nYours faithfully,\\nAlex Barret\\nReply\\nQuote\\n×\\nReport\\nReport\\nClose"]'::jsonb,
