  E'["Dear Frank,\\nThanks for your email that gives so many details about what is happening with your life. I''m glad to know about them. And I hope that the weather is pleasant for your liking.\\nI understand that you are seeking my advice in learning a new sport which you are going to like and enjoy playing. I think that indoor table tennis is the best sport for you to try. I''m recommending this indoor sport for you because it''ll save you from the uncomfortable heat and humidity of the outdoors.\\nLearning to play table tennis is rather easy and fun. In fact, if you can move fast and spin your wrist at will to hit the ball, you''re a winner in this game! In other words, it''s all about speed and timing rather than strength. But, before all of that, you need to practice bouncing the ball so that you can develop your control as well as your feel for the bat on the ball. But, guess what, I have got an even better idea! How about we learn this sport together!\\nSee you soon. Take care.\\nWarm regards,\\nGeorge", "Dear Ethina,\\nI hope you''re doing great by the grace of almighty! I’m really excited that you want to learn a new sport, and I think badminton would be a great choice for you. It’s fun, easy to pick up, and an excellent way to stay active. Plus, you don’t need a lot of expensive equipment - just a racket, a shuttlecock, and some comfortable sportswear.\\nTo get started, you could join a beginner’s class at a local sports centre, preferably at Linda''s Sports & Fitness. They offer lessons with professional coaches who can teach you the basics, such as proper footwork, racket grip, and different shots. If you prefer something more casual, we could book a court at the local sports hall and practice together. There are also plenty of online tutorials that explain techniques and strategies, which can help speed up your progress.\\nSince I’ve also been wanting to get back into playing badminton, how about we learn together? It’ll be more fun and motivating to practice as a team, and we can even join some friendly local matches once we improve!\\nLet me know when you''re free, and we’ll get started. Looking forward to it!\\nBest wishes,\\nCatherine\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 3.82 (17 Votes)\\nGT Writing Task 1\\nInformative-letter\\nemail writing\\nemail to friend\\nLetter Writing Sample\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\nKhalid\\n1 year 11 months\\nDear Amjad,\\nI hope that you''re doing well. I''ve recently received your email and found that you''re interested in a new sport and need my help.\\nAs we’ve studied in the same school, and I know your interests and hobbies, I think that volleyball will be the best sport for you because you’re a tall person and it''s the main feature of selection in this sport. Secondly, you’re very interested in throwing a football using one hand during tournaments in school when you were playing as a goalkeeper.\\nIn my area, there is a sports complex where volleyball is being taught. Since it is not available in most sports complexes due to the lack of interest of people, so don’t go anywhere else.\\nNowadays, I have free time in the morning because I''m working the evening shift. If you manage your free time reflecting with my time, then I can also join you and we both can learn this new interesting sport.\\nLet me know if you find anything confusing, and I will clarify it.\\nBest wishes,\\nKhalid\\nReply\\nQuote\\nYella\\n2 years 9 months\\nDear Elon,\\nI hope this email finds you well. I understand that you''re interested in learning a new sport, and I''ve got the perfect one in my mind for you, and it is none other than \\"tennis\\". Tennis is a great sport that''s not only fun but also has numerous health benefits such as improving cardiovascular health, increasing strength and agility, and promoting mental focus. And I am hoping you would enjoy it a lot.\\nTo learn tennis, there are a few things you could do. Firstly, you could hire a coach who would teach you the basics of the sport, such as how to hold the racket, how to serve, and how to hit the ball. Secondly, you could join a local tennis club where you can play with other beginners and improve your skills. Or, you could practice with a friend, which leads me to my next point.\\nI would love to learn tennis with you! It would be a great way for us to spend time together and get some exercise. I''ve played tennis before and would be happy to teach you what I know. We could also hire a coach or join a local club together to take our skills to the next level.\\nLet me know what you think about this suggestion. I''m excited about the possibility of learning tennis with you and can''t wait to get started!\\nBest regards,\\nYella\\nReply\\nQuote\\n×\\nReport\\nReport\\nClose"]'::jsonb,
