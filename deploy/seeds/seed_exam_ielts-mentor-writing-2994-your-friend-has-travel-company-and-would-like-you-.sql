Hope you are doing well with your work and family. Anyway, I am delighted and flattered about the fact that you have actually thought of me as a prospective business partner of yours and invited me to work with you at your travel agency.\\nBy the way, I know how you have worked for several travel companies before starting your own company at a small office about 5 years ago. Today, with your hard works, and with more than 500,000 (in US dollars) yearly business turnover, your travel agency has managed to establish itself as one of the most successful small businesses and innovative entrepreneurs in our country. Besides, your customer retention rate is phenomenal, especially, among the travellers who fly to East Europe.\\nBut, despite all this success of your business, I will have to turn down your offer to work with you in the capacity of a Deputy General Manager of your company, primarily because I can’t leave my elderly parents all by themselves in my town. Besides, I like my current job. Hope you will understand.\\nI hope we can meet soon and spend a good time together.\\nWarm wishes,\\nKyle\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 5.00 (5 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nInformal Letter\\nPersonal Letter\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\nAjay Wadkar\\n5 years 6 months\\nHi Shawn,\\nHope you are doing excellent!

To be exact, I can join on the first of October.\\nI already know about your company - XYZ Limited, which is a reputed company in Information and Technology world with a billion dollars revenue club. In the past, I personally heard about very good feedback from a lot of my friends about the company. It has employee-friendly policies as well as good compensation along with flexibility in work hours. Besides, it has its presence across the globe and in all the major cities in India. No doubt, it''s a great company to work in.\\nIn my current organisation, I’m working on multiple projects which are very critical in terms of business. A few project owners are our decade-old clients. So, I need at least three months to hand over the projects and then join your company.

I know you started this company just four years ago, and in such a short period, it has reached such a great height. I believe it was possible just because of your relentless efforts and rigorous decisions. Now it is a well-known name in the travel industry, and I wish soon it will become the best and one of the largest travel companies in our country.\\nNo doubt, it would be a great opportunity and pleasure to work in your company, but I''ve decided to study further. For this reason alone, I would have to decline the fabulous offer. In fact, I have already got admitted to a Master''s course at a university in London.
