  E'["Dear David,\\nI hope you are doing great. I am so excited to be your pen pal and writing my first letter to introduce myself. I hope you will write to me someday as I would like to know more about you.\\nAs you already know I live in Manila, the capital of the Philippines and a bayside city on the island of Luzon, which mixes Spanish colonial architecture with modern skyscrapers. It is a lively city with more than 1.8 million population.\\nRegarding my education, I have completed my graduation from the University of Santo Tomas, Manila and my major was Bachelor of Business Administration. I finished my MBA at the University of the East in 2019 and soon after that, I started working for Ayala Corporation - one of the largest holding companies in the Philippines. I am now a senior executive in this company.\\nI was so excited to know that you maintain a blog as I also do it. You can visit my personal blog at www.daniel-francis.wordpress.com. Besides, I am a volunteer for a charity organisation that works for the destitute and less privileged population in our city. I am so surprised that you also like travelling as it is my passion to be able to visit different parts of the world.\\nI would like to thank you for inviting me to the UK. I am sure I will someday visit you and explore this great country.\\nTake care and write me back when time allows you to do so.\\nWarm wishes,\\nDaniel Francis", "Dear John,\\nI am Raj from Delhi, India, writing to introduce myself. As a pen pal, I want to let you know more about me. I would like to thank you for your letter and it was nice knowing so many things about you. I must say, you have a great way of writing.\\nWe both share many common interests and hobbies and it is indeed a great surprise. The subjects that we had opted in for our respective college and university education were coincidentally common. As a matter of fact, it is due to this reason both of our employment sector and job responsibilities are strikingly similar. Ironically, the respective companies in which we both are employed are archrivals in the industry of Finance and Banking.\\nI would like to update you about some of the recent events. I have lately joined yoga and meditation classes. However, I still do not miss my age-old hobby of swimming. It is hard to recollect even a single day, barring the weekly off, when I miss a dip in the swimming pool. Apart from this, my weekends are generally devoted to spending time strictly with my family. The overall credit for my health, however, goes to the one and a half session of yoga classes in the morning.\\nThank you for inviting me to visit your city. I will certainly try to come and meet you. Let us catch up in the coming December and till then take care and keep in touch.\\nWarm wishes,\\nNeeraj Mehra\\n[", "Dear Adam,\\nMy name is Alex Green, and I received your name and mailing address from a renowned magazine in Japan called Nara Pen Pals. I am very excited to have this opportunity to write to you and become pen pals. I hope you would write me back.\\nI’m currently working as a computer programmer in a large multinational company in Japan. I graduated from Waseda University with a Bachelor’s degree in computer science in December 2022. While I greatly enjoy my current job, I’m interested in pursuing a Master’s degree and hope to begin graduate studies next March. My hobbies include blogging, travelling listening to rock music, playing the piano and playing table tennis. I try to visit a different country each year and so far had been to eight of them.\\nI would be glad to meet you someday. I hope I would be able to become your friend and then meet you to know more about you.\\nWell, let me finish here. I am already eagerly awaiting your reply to this first letter. Please tell me all about yourself and your interests.\\nWarm wishes,\\nDaniel Red", "Dear Ahmed,\\nHope this letter finds you well. I am very excited to have this opportunity to write to you as a pen pal. I hope we would become good friends.\\nIn my first letter to you, I would like to tell you about my education, job and hobbies. I completed my graduation from the University of Edinvera in 2020 and my major was data engineering. Afterwards, I joined the multinational company - Siemens, as a data analyst. I still work there and I really enjoy my job. I like to explore the world and meet new people to know about their traditions and lifestyle. So far I had been to more than 10 countries and planning to visit Italy this summer. I am health conscious and regularly take part in physical activities. For this reason, I am an active member of the renowned fitness centre ‘Shape’.\\nI hope we would be able to extend our friendship and become good buddies. I would be glad to meet you in person sometime in the middle of next year when I will be visiting your country.\\nWarm regards,\\nFahad Sultan\\n["]'::jsonb,
