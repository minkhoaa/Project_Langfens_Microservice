I''m writing this letter to share some exciting news. You''d be glad to learn that I''m planning to join a network course in your city.\\nFirst of all, I''m extremely sorry for not writing to you for ages. I''ve been so busy over the last year due to my network education from Huawei Technologies. I started Huawei''s basic network certification course HCNA program in 2017 which led to advanced courses HCNP & HCIE. Study & lab work for these certifications are very difficult, and I did complete these courses after a lot of hard work, dedication and guidance from Corvit Systems Lahore under the supervision of Mr Haroon Malik. To improve my education & multi-vendor experience in network studies, I''ve planned to study CISCO technologies.\\nTo start these courses, I need to visit the UAE next month for which I''ve already completed my visa process. As you are living in the UAE for the past 7 years, I think you have good experience to find out some good institutes for me where I can get basic training to pass the CISCO exam & get good experience in my professional carrier.\\nI hope to hear good feedback from you soon.\\nThanks & good wishes,\\nTayyab\\nReply\\nQuote\\n×\\nReport\\nReport\\nClose"]'::jsonb,
