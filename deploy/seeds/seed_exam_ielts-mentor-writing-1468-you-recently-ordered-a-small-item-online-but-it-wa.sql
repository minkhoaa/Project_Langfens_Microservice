  E'["Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI am James Smith, a resident of Aurora, Illinois, have recently ordered a smartphone - Samsung Galaxy Note Edge, from your online shop. Unfortunately, when I unwrapped the phone, I found that the phone screen was broken and the stylus was missing. I am writing to notify you of the problem and to replace my product with a fresh one.\\nI placed the order on 15th July 2025 from my home and my invoice number is SAI-25478ASNE. I used my VISA credit card to pay for the order. I was looking forward to receiving the phone and start using it but when the phone finally arrived two days later, it was not in the condition it should have been. The main screen was smashed, and I could not find the stylus in the box. This is quite unexpected and as a regular customer, I am disappointed with your service.\\nPlease inform me how can I replace the phone, as the warranty covers it, and get a fresh one as early as possible? Should I visit one of your retail shops?\\nThanks in advance for your cooperation and I would like you to take the necessary measure so that it does not repeat in the future.\\nYours faithfully,\\nJames Smith", "Dear Sir or Madam,\\nFive days ago I ordered a headphone from your online store. I was excited when it arrived yesterday but very frustrated to find that the product was damaged. I am not sure if it got damaged during the shipment or was a manufacturing flaw. In either case, I am hoping you will replace it with a fresh one.\\nIn relation to the specifics of the order, I purchased this ''Sony MDR-V6 Over the Ear Headphones - Black'' through your website called Computer Gadgets on August 18th using my PayPal account. The order number is 5487214 and I am attaching a copy of my receipt.\\nThe issue with the headphone is that one swivel air cup was missing, and the play/pause button does not work. I am unable to use it. I’m sure this is either a manufacturing flaw or the product got damaged while shipment.\\nAs a solution, and because I really like the model and functionality of the headphone, I am hoping that you will agree to send me another one for free. Otherwise, I would like a full refund and I will be contacting PayPal complaints if I do not hear back from you in regards to this within a week.\\nThank you for giving the matter your attention and I hope to hear your reply soon.\\nYours faithfully,\\nJenny Sahara\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 4.89 (9 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nGT Writing Task 1\\nFormal Letter\\nComplaints-letter\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\nNisha Sangwan\\n9 years 10 months\\nDear Paul,Hope you are doing great. It''s been so long since I last wrote you and you have been silent from your end as well. I want to share a good news with you - I have got a new job with an attractive package, lucrative benefits and better career prospects and I will move to your city next month.I want some help from you before moving to this city and it is related to finding a place to live in. I want to reside near the South Delhi resident. My office is in South Delhi centre area, so I want a place close to my office. Even my children’s school will be near my office. So I think this location would ideal for me and my family. I heard many times that traffic is a big problem in Delhi, so I believe staying near my office and children’s school would be the perfect solution to avoid choking traffic problems. Furthermore, I would prefer to rent a flat with two bedrooms, one kitchen, one guest room and a large hall. However, I would like to have a flat with amenities such as playground, parking area and of course full-time security.I am sure you will help me out to find a good accommodation so that I can settle down quickly and without much hassle. I will inform you shortly my date of arrival.Best regards,Smith.\\nReply\\nQuote\\n×\\nReport\\nReport\\nClose"]'::jsonb,
