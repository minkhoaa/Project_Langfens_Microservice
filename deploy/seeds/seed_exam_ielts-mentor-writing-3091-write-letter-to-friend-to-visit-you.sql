  E'["Dear Anila,\\nI hope you''re doing great and can write back to me about the things you''ve been doing these days. I would love to have you among us in India, and this coming Republic Day is an excellent opportunity to enjoy a public holiday together.\\nYou can fly to India from Kuwait on 24th January, and stay with us for a week or so. Last time you wrote to me that you''ve available paid vacations that you''re planning to take. I think you should take it now and visit us.\\nRepublic Day, in India, honours the date on which the \\"Constitution of India\\" came into effect on 26 January 1950 replacing the Government of India Act (1935) as the governing document of India. On that day, we, as a nation, formally adopted the Constitution as the guiding document and became an independent republic! The main Republic Day celebration is held in the national capital, New Delhi, and this is an excellent opportunity to enjoy the national parade and show our respect.\\nI also have several other plans for us. I''ll take you to my cousin''s graduation day, which is on 29th January. On the 31st night, we will have a party where I''ll invite our common friends and welcome the new year.\\nI''m eagerly waiting to hear that you would be able to make it.\\nWith love and warm wishes,\\nDiya", "Dear Terry,\\nHope you are enjoying yourself and keeping busy with your work just as you always like to do. I''m writing this letter to invite you to one of the biggest, if not the biggest, and special public events of my country which is called “Independence Day”. But, this event is going to be even more special this time since we are going to celebrate the golden jubilee of our independence.\\nTo give you a little idea about how we celebrate our independence day, there''ll be huge and colourful parades at one of the largest stadiums of our capital city, where I currently live, which will also be attended by many dignitaries from around the world. At the event, you''ll also get to enjoy the air show where some daring aerobatics demonstrations of our military aircraft will be on display.\\nThen, at night, I also have a plan to take you out to enjoy some of the most beautiful and mesmerising fireworks, you would ever get to see, followed by a special cultural show and dinner at our town hall.\\nSo, I''m hoping to meet you soon.\\nWarm wishes,\\nZayed\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 4.50 (8 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nGT Writing Task 1\\nletter to a friend\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\nRitu\\n6 years 3 months\\nWho celebrates the new year on 31st January?
