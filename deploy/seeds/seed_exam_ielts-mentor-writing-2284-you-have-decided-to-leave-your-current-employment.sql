  E'["Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI have been working in your company as a software engineer since 2020 and it is an absolute honour to have been a part of this great company. I am writing to inform you that I have decided to discontinue my service effective from September 01, 2025. As per my employment agreement, I am giving one month''s notice prior to leaving, dated from today.\\nIt was a tough decision for me because of the opportunity and recognition I have received so far. It was a perfect and conducive working environment that has an undeniable impression on me. However, I have recently accepted a job in Australia and need to move there in three months. My family lives there and I had been planning to be with them for a long.\\nI will settle in Australi and work as a software engineer there. This would help me stay close to my family and further enhance my career.\\nI would like to show my gratitude to all who have helped me in my journey.\\nYours faithfully,\\nFahad Sultan\\n[", "Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI am writing this letter to inform you about my decision not to continue serving your company. After giving a lot of thought and consideration to my current situation, I have finally decided to leave your company, effective from 1st of August 2025, and pursue another course of plan and career in future.\\nIn fact, I want to work in the field of Horticulture. But, please know that I have learned about a lot of things after working at your company. Besides, each and every staff at your company has treated me like their family just as I have done with them. So, there is absolutely nothing wrong as far as your company and my current position are concerned.\\nBy the way, I want to pursue my career as a Horticulturist because my family has some substantial land property and gardens which I want to look after, and possibly expand them as much as I can. It is just that for the last couple of years, I have felt really strongly about working in the field and remain close to Mother Nature instead of getting stuck in an office environment.\\nThank you once again for everything you have done for me. I will be always indebted.\\nYours faithfully,\\nPema Lingpa\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 4.31 (16 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nGT Writing Task 1\\nFormal Letter\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\n×\\nReport\\nReport\\nClose"]'::jsonb,
