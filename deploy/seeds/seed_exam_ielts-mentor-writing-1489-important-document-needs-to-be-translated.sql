  E'You should spend about\n20\nminutes on this task.\nYou have received an important document that needs to be translated. Write a letter to your friend and ask him/her to translate this important document for you.\nIn your letter, explain -\nwhy it is important for you\nhow fast you need it back\nwhy you need his/her expertise\nYou should write at least\n150\nwords.\nYou do\nNOT\nneed to write your own address.\nBegin your letter as follows:\nDear ..................,\nModel\nAnswer 1:\nDear Lee,\nHope you and your parents are doing excellent. I am sorry that I have not been in touch with you for the last couple of weeks. Even if I have not written to you for a while, you are always in my thoughts and prayer. I am writing to you today because I need your expertise to translate some important documents for me.\nYou would be glad to know that my application has been accepted by the Wuhan University in China and if things go as planned, I will join the university next summer for my Master''s degree. They have sent me some documents which are in the Chinese language and I need your help with that. You are the best person to assist me and this is really crucial for me to get admitted to this University. Without the proper translation of the documents, I will not be able to respond precisely to them.\nI am sending xerox copies of these documents, three documents with 7 pages in total, and would really appreciate it if you can send them before 10th December. I could use Google Translate to interpret the texts but you know there are always glitches in this technology as some meanings are lost in translation! Your excellent skills in English and Chinese makes you the most suitable person to translate those documents for me. I owe you a big one.\nTake care and write me back whenever possible.\nWarm wishes,\nKyle',

  E'["Dear Mitchell,\\nI hope that this letter finds you in great health and jovial spirit. I know, I didn’t write to you in the last few months, but it’s because I was really busy with my work. Anyway, I am writing to you this time because I could use your help in translating a foreign document, written in the German language, which I received about a week ago from a German company in response to a job application which I sent about a couple of months ago.\\nNow, I know a little German language, but it is certainly not good enough to translate this document into English because, after reading it a little, I felt that this document is talking about the conditions for availing of this job. By the way, I know about your German language skill, and I know that you would do a great job in translating this document for me.\\nTherefore, please help me translate the photocopy of this foreign document so that I can offer my feedback and answer this letter as soon as I can. I would also appreciate it if you could translate it at your earliest convenience, hopefully before the end of this week.\\nTake care.\\nWarm wishes,\\nBenjamin\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 4.85 (10 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nGT Writing Task 1\\nInformal Letter\\nPersonal Letter\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\nAudra\\n6 years 10 months\\nHello, I am so happy that I found your webpage.
