  E'["Dear Rohan,\\nHope this letter finds you in good health and spirit. I haven’t heard from you since we did some mountain hiking together about a year ago.  Anyway, you surely will be glad to know that I''ll be visiting Granville - the town where you went to university. I''ll be there from the 7th of October till the 10th of the month for the purpose of attending a big car auction in order to buy an old but good car for me at an affordable price.\\nI''ll be staying at Maple Leaf hotel in the downtown of your city which is located right at the intersection of Jenkins Avenue and O’Conner Street.  Now, I''m not too sure how far exactly you''re from the hotel, but I''d be more than happy to see you at my hotel.  But, if you''re too busy to visit me during one of those weekdays because of your work, please just let me know where I can enjoy some nice Japanese foods, along with some nice oriental music, during the evening.\\nI guess, that should do it for now, but please do feel free to visit me when I arrive in your city.\\nWarm wishes,\\nWilliam", "Dear Rony,\\nHope you''re doing great. I''m planning to take my wife and daughter to Marshville to spend our summer holiday. We''ll be visiting this town at the beginning of the next month primarily to enjoy the beautiful hills, and the sea beach while also meeting a distant relative. Since you went to the university in this very town, I''m sure you''d be able to help me with some information.\\nWe are planning to stay the first three days at Hotel Tulip, near the sea beach, and then spend the next two days at the Martharry area near the town centre. The day before we take our return flight, we''ll be visiting the relative at his home near the Hunsberry area. Our main focus during this tour would be to enjoy our holidays as much as possible.\\nI''ve done some online research about the places to visit and things to do once we''re there. However, I''d request you to recommend some evening activities and entertainment that we may enjoy as a family. I''d also welcome any other tips and recommendations that you might have.\\nTake care. See you soon.\\nYours truly,\\nAlbert\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 3.36 (11 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nGT Writing Task 1\\nInformal Letter\\nPersonal Letter\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\nPrageeth\\n3 years 3 months\\nI''ve some doubt about this. The question mentioned the town of the friend''s university. But the letter is in the friend''s city. Isn''t this off-topic?\\nReply\\nQuote\\nAbisai Ndamanomhata\\n3 years 6 months\\nVery good!\\nReply\\nQuote\\nAbisai Ndamanomhata\\n3 years 6 months\\nOffers useful information.
