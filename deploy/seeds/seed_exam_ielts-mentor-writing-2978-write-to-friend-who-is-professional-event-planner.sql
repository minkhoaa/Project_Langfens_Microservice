  E'["Dear Amelia,\\nHope you are doing fine. It was so delightful to hear that you had a memorable tour in Europe, and I''m sure that would revive you to the fullest.

I am also doing fine except that I am really struggling to put together a plan to celebrate my parent''s 40th wedding anniversary in a very special manner.\\nFor a minute, I thought that I was going to take them to the same place where they spent their first vacation. Then, I also thought I should buy them the same kind of dresses which they wore on their wedding day. But, I finally thought that as a professional event planner, you are the best person to assist me in planning this unique event.\\nNot to mention, this wedding anniversary is quite special for all of us as it marks 40 years of shared love. It is unique to my parents also since, after all these years, they both have finally fulfilled their dream of buying a beautiful house in the lovely countryside where they want to spend the rest of their lives. Besides, this wedding anniversary would also allow them to show their love and appreciation for each other.\\nSo, given how special this occasion is, please inform me about a date and time when you can meet me and give me some professional advice on how to make the event memorable and exceptional.\\nHope to see you soon. Take care.\\nWarm wishes,\\nJenny\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 4.85 (10 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nGT Writing Task 1\\nInformal Letter\\nPersonal Letter\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\nAssies\\n7 years 7 months\\nHi.\\nReply\\nQuote\\n×\\nReport\\nReport\\nClose"]'::jsonb,
