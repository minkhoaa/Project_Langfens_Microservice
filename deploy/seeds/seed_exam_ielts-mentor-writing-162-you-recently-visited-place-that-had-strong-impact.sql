  E'["Dear Samuel,\\nI hope you are doing excellent. I am writing to inform you about a place I had been to for the first time and the experience is overwhelming. I would like to take you there and show you how this part of the city is different from the rest.\\nRecently, I, along with a group of people, visited a slum area as part of social activity. This slum is situated in a distant place, away from the city outskirts and could be reached on foot only. Upon entering the area, I was surprised by the children who were ready to welcome us; they were eagerly waiting that someone would bring something for them to eat. We spent about 4 hours playing games, explained to them the importance of personal hygiene, taught them few important social aspects, gave them food which we took along with us and at the end of the session we distributed around 30 winter blankets for each family in the slum. When we were in the midst of the slum, I personally saw and felt their poverty, their longing for help and their need for social awareness. When we were leaving, I was so happy to see the smiles on their faces.\\nThe trip to the slum infused me with an idea to gather a few more and ask them for their help in supporting the slum dwellers. I know that you are very much interested in these types of philanthropic activities.\\nIf you agree, we can visit there next week and help them in any way possible.\\nYours truly,\\nPrasad\\n[", "Dear Gretel,\\nHope you are doing great. I am writing this letter to tell you about a fascinating place that I discovered unexpectedly very near to our college. I would like you to join me next time I go there.\\nWhile cycling last morning, I took a detour from our regular path and cycled along the banks of the stream that passes behind the main college building. After one kilometre or so, I reached a dead end and when I was about to turn, I became anxious to know where the stream goes beyond this as I could see no land post that end. I was gasped to see that the small looking stream turned into a beautiful waterfall with sun-raises cutting through the water and displaying prism colours. The place looked so serene and calm. The most astonishing part was the beauty of nature and I wished to stay there for long.\\nAs I know you have an interest in photography, I do not think you should miss taking pictures of this wonderful place. I will be cycling to this place again on Saturday and I would really want you to come along with me and see the beauty of nature for yourself.\\nSee you on Saturday!\\nBest wishes,\\nGemma\\n[", "Dear Leon,\\nI have just returned from my holidays in France and while we were there we climbed a mountain called ''Parleman'' in the French Alps. We were able to drive halfway up the mountain but then the road stopped. So we parked, put on our walking boots and began the long uphill struggle. But the place was a bit of heaven and I wish to take you to this excellent place someday.\\nIn spite of the road at the beginning, it still took us a while to complete the climb but it was well worth the effort. When we got to the top of the mountain, the view was incredible. I could see right across the town and the lake to one side, and on the other side were the snow-covered peaks of Mont Blanc. It was simply breathtaking.\\nAs you know, we often go to France for our holiday and next time we plan a trip, I''d really like to take you there. I''m sure you would love the scenery and as you enjoy exercise, you would be able to take advantage of all the mountain walks.\\nHope to meet you soon.\\nWarm wishes,\\nPaul\\nIELTS GT Writing Task 1 / Letter Writing Topic:\\nYou recently visited a place that had a strong impact on you.

In your letter,\\n» explain where the place was and how you got there\\n» describe what you saw\\n» offer to take your friend there\\nWrite at least\\n150\\nwords.", "Dear Rahul,\\nLast week I went to Mysore on a fabulous trip. The local tourist centre suggested that I should visit the royal palace of Tipu Sultan, the Nizam of Karnataka in the 16th century. The place was a jewel and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I would like to take you there next time.\\nOn the day of my visit, coincidently it was also the festival of Dussehra and the whole palace was lit up brightly as part of the celebration. According to a local, the electricity used up on that day to light up the palace is almost equal to the electricity used up by the city throughout the year! The interior of the palace was as amazing as the gleaming exterior. There were specimens of weapons that were used during the wars in those times, pictures painted on the canvas of the royal family, details of the wars fought by the King and many more interesting things which are important from the point of view of Indian culture and history.\\nI wish to visit the palace again same time next year to be a part of the grand celebration and I would like to invite you to join me. I promise it would be a great experience.\\nWarm wishes,\\nRipal\\n[", "Dear Kakoli,\\nHope you are doing great. I was away for a meditation course for a week and after my arrival, I got to see the beautiful birthday gift sent by you. Thank you so much. I had a nice vacation at the ‘Art of Living’ meditation centre and enjoyed my birthday amid perfect serenity.\\nWords are few to describe the place. Though located in a populated area like Bangalore, the meditation centre is very calm. What I liked most is my fellow participants; they were full of positive energy. I feel I have rediscovered myself in just those seven days. Believe it or not, I was in total silence for four days. In those four days, I could deeply reflect on my life goal and what I really want to do.\\nWhy don’t you join me the next time? I know you are quite fond of meditation and yoga, so let’s plan a trip.\\nTake care and see you soon.\\nWarm wishes,\\nUshree\\n["]'::jsonb,
