  E'["Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI am writing in response to a letter that I received recently stating that my insurance premium would increase from July 2020. I do not believe the increase is rational and hence would like you to reconsider it.\\nI have been managing my car insurance with your company for the last 8 years and my insurance policy number is 8101023457-115-2. My monthly premium is already higher than that of some of my colleagues and relatives. The 20% increase in monthly insurance payment is not acceptable because I am already paying higher and no other notable insurance company has raised their premium recently.\\nInflating the premium, especially at a time of recession, goes against the insurance holders'' interest. I would really appreciate it if you could write me back with an explanation of why such an increase is needed when others have not done so. I would request you to reconsider the decision, otherwise, I am afraid I will have to move my car insurance policy to another company.\\nI am looking forward to receiving your reply as soon as possible.\\nYours faithfully,\\nSonia Vincent\\n[", "Dear Sir or Madam,\\nYesterday I received a letter from your company regarding a decision to increase the monthly car insurance premium by 15% effective from next month. I, however, feel that the decision is one-sided and contradicts the interests of your customers. I am hoping that you would reconsider and keep the premium unchanged.\\nI have been managing both my car and life insurance with your company for the last 15 years. I even updated the car insurance policy at the end of last year when I sold my old car and purchased a new one. As per my findings, I am already paying a bit higher for my car insurance and that is why a further increase in the monthly premium is unjustified. I have always paid the premium in due time and you can check that from your database. My car insurance policy number is 2510236-254/1.\\nSince I am not willing to pay an exorbitant amount for my insurance but want to manage it with your company, I am hoping that you would reconsider your decision of raising the monthly amount. Otherwise, I would be forced to move my policy to another company.\\nI really appreciate your time and would like to get a reply from you soon.\\nYours faithfully,\\nJonathan Stuart\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 5.00 (7 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nGT Writing Task 1\\nFormal Letter\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\nNeha\\n8 years 4 months\\nShouldn''t it be \\"a letter you sent me\\" rather than \\"a letter you send me\\"?\\nReply\\nQuote\\n×\\nReport\\nReport\\nClose"]'::jsonb,
