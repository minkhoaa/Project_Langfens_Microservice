  E'["Dear Leo,\\nI hope you''re doing great. I''ve recently joined a multinational company, and many of my colleagues speak Spanish in the workplace.  I studied basic Spanish in high school and have always felt a fascination with this language. Moreover, I believe, I would work more efficiently if I speak Spanish with my coworkers.  So I thought it was time to get in touch with you and get some help since you’re a fluent speaker of Spanish.\\nI wonder if you could give me a few tips on how to speed up my Spanish learning? Do you think I should get a self-study book, or watch some video tutorials from YouTube? Sometimes I think about getting enrolled in a Spanish language course, but I''m not sure if it''ll suit me. I think you can guide me on this. I''ll be looking forward to your tips and advice.\\nIf you’re going to be in the area in the next few days, we could get together, and I could pick your brains about this subject. We haven''t been to an authentic Chinese restaurant for a while, and we could discuss it in detail over dinner someday.\\nI hope to see you soon. Take care and stay fine.\\nYours truly,\\nStephen\\n[[", "Dear Olivia,\\nI hope that you''re doing excellent. It''s been awfully long since we''ve last seen each other and spent some quality time together. I really miss those days when we could hang out almost every day.\\nAnyway, after graduating from university next summer, I''ll start looking for a job in a multination company. Besides, I''ve plans to pursue my Master''s degree at a UK university a couple of years later. Considering my plans and expectations, I''ve started honing my English language skills, which, I believe, will be vital for my further study and career success. In a multinational company, English would be highly essential for communication.\\nYou already know that my command of the English language is not so good. I make many grammatical mistakes and can''t express my feelings and ideas effectively in complex situations. As a native speaker of the English language, your skills are enviable. I hope you can suggest how I can improve my skills and learn the language efficiently without making any grammatical mistakes. I also want to learn fast and you''re the best person to advise me on that.\\nIf it''s not too much to ask, I''d like to meet you in person to discuss everything in detail and have some pleasant time together. We have a lot to catch up with, I believe.\\nYour suggestions would be quite valuable to me. Hope we can plan our meeting soon.\\nYours truly,\\nPolina\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 4.50 (8 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nInformal Letter\\nPersonal Letter\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\nKanwal Kashan\\n4 years 1 month\\nYou are currently trying to improve your knowledge of a language which is not your first language.

I am writing to you after a long time as I was so busy during the past couple of months. I''ve enrolled in an MBA programme at the International University of Sienna, and almost 95% of students and teachers speak Italian. To communicate effectively, I believe I need to learn Italian. You have spent nine years of your life in Italy and speak Italian like natives, so I believe you can help me with that.\\nI need your suggestions and help on achieving that. Please inform me if there is any mobile application or website from where I can learn the basics of this language? Which approach do you think would be best for me to quickly learn this language so that I can effectively communicate with my teachers and classmates?\\nSince we are now in the same city, let''s grab a cup of coffee at a place that would suit you and discuss this matter in detail. We also have not been together for a long and that would be an excellent opportunity to do that.\\nI will be waiting for your answer. Take Care.\\nWarm wishes,\\nAnna Augustus\\nReply\\nQuote\\n×\\nReport\\nReport\\nClose"]'::jsonb,
