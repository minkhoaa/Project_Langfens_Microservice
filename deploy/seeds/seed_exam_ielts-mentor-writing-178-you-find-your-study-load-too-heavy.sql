  E'You should spend about\n20\nminutes on this task.\nYou find that your study load is too heavy and you would like to withdraw from two courses.\nWrite a letter to your college teacher explaining why you need to withdraw from two courses. Ask if it is possible to obtain a refund.\nYou should write at least 150 words.\nYou do\nNOT\nneed to write any addresses.\nBegin your letter as follows:\nDear ...................\n,\nSample\nAnswer 1:\nDear Mrs Tereshkova,\nI am writing to request your permission to withdraw from two courses that I find extremely difficult to manage due to the study pressure in this term. Besides, I am in the college football league and we have our annual inter-college competition this November. I am hoping to get your approval to withdraw from these two courses which I intend to take during the next semester.\nI was perhaps overly optimistic and unaware of the study pressure when I registered for six courses at the beginning of the summer semester. The classes, regular assignments and practice session with the football team demands a great deal of time and I am already lagging behind the schedule with my study and work. I would, therefore, request your permission to withdraw from courses ''The material text or Shakespeare (CMT 204)'' and ''Literature in English 1350–1550 (CLE 208)''. I will intake these courses next term so that I can finish my courses in due time.\nAccording to our university intake rules, if someone withdraws from a course before the first term, he would be eligible for an 80% refund and I am hoping for a tuition refund as I am applying within the prescribed timeframe. My sincere apology for any inconveniences caused by this change in plans.\nShould there any query or question I am available to meet you in person to discuss them.\nI look forward to hearing from you soon.\nYours sincerely,\nDave Franco',

  E'["Dear Mr Martin,\\nI am writing to formally request you to permit me to withdraw from two courses: Financial and Management Accounting (CFM403) and Quantitative Methods in Business II (QMB 409). I find my study pressure higher than I can manage and I am hoping you would authorise me to withdraw from these two courses.\\nI have decided to withdraw from these two courses as I am finding it extremely difficult to manage six courses this semester. I was perhaps overly optimistic about juggling both my full-time studies and my part-time job at the beginning of the term. I registered for six courses hoping to finish them all in this term but I was not realistic at that time. Instead, I am now planning on taking these two courses during the winter semester if they are available at that time. Thus I will be able to complete all the courses for the degree program by the following year.\\nI would also like to request a tuition refund and hope I am not too late to receive the full reimbursement. I am sorry for any inconveniences I have caused by this change in plans. This decision was not taken lightly, and I do appreciate the kind consideration you have shown to me.\\nThank you for your attention to these requests. If you need any information, I am available to meet you and discuss it in person.\\nI look forward to hearing from you soon.\\nYours sincerely,\\nAlex Dalton", "Dear Prof. Robert,\\nI hope that this letter finds you in good health and spirit. I am sorry that it has come to this, but it looks like I won’t be able to carry the study load of so many courses this semester. In fact, I am writing this letter to formally request your permission to withdraw from two courses which are Financial Management and Business Law.\\nAnyway, the main reason for reducing my course load at this time is because I am finding it a bit too difficult to manage 5 courses. Of course, you would probably wonder as to why I didn’t think of this at the beginning of the semester. Well, the answer is that I was probably a bit too optimistic about the prospect of finishing my university education quickly. Besides, I didn’t also think that my part-time job would come in the way to harm my studies like this. But, I was proved wrong on all accounts.\\nTherefore, in light of my current situation, I was just wondering if you would allow me to withdraw from at least two courses and get a refund for them.\\nYours sincerely,\\nAndre Mitchell\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 3.96 (14 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nGT Writing Task 1\\nSemi-formal Letter\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\nVineeth\\n10 years 5 months\\nDear Prof. Rony, I am Jonathan Hopes, an enrolled student for the English training courses at your Institute. I find it cumbersome to review the class reports back at home. I am writing to request you to withdraw me from listening and reading classes. I got admitted to your institute on 4th May this year and I am currently pursuing all the four language development courses offered by your Institute. Unlike the first few weeks where I had been able to cope up with the vastness of all four courses, now at the beginning of the advanced lessons, I find it quite difficult to keep up with class revisions. All the four courses at the same time come with hours of home works and due to this, I am forced to sleep fewer hours at night and days have become tiring for that. Given the situation, I would like to request you to kindly withdraw me from listening and reading course so as to ensure my thorough revision of homework. At the time of enrollment I did pay for all four courses, I would also like to enquire whether a refund of the withdrawn course is possible? I would also take this opportunity to appreciate the manner the course is conducted by you.Thanking youJones.\\nReply\\nQuote\\n×\\nReport\\nReport\\nClose"]'::jsonb,
