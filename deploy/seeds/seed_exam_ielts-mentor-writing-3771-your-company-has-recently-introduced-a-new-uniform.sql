  E'["Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI am a Senior Executive at our company, and I am writing this letter to say a few words about the new uniform code of our company which, I do not think, is exactly appreciated by many of our company staff.\\nThe problem is that the majority of the staff of our company think that a new uniform code is just a waste of time and money because it does not really help increase our productivity in any way.  Besides, they are also saying in private that they are not willing to accept this new uniform code because they think that the colours of the dresses are too “generic” and do not quite go along with the prestige and reputation of our company.\\nSo, now that we know why the staffs are not ready to approve this new uniform code, the management can actually suggest a different colour code (could be more than just one colour as long as they are “unique”). Not only that but also the company can make an offer to pay for the making charges of the uniforms to make this new uniform proposal even more appealing to them.\\nI hope you will consider my opinion and suggestions.\\nYours faithfully,\\nJim McEnroe", "Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI am writing this letter to inform you that many of our staff members are not exactly happy with the announcement of a new uniform. And I believe that our higher management should take some initiatives to make it more acceptable to all.\\nI think most employees in our company are dissatisfied with this new dress code because they do not like the colour combination of the proposed dresses. They have also expressed their concerns in private about wearing such dresses on a hot summer day, especially since we often have power cuts during the summer.\\nI think the colour that the management has proposed for the new uniform should be revised as it mimics the dress code of healthcare service providers while most of our employees are technicians. The new uniform should also give our employees the freedom to choose the type of fabrics rather than imposing a single one on them.\\nPerhaps, the company should ask a few employees to talk to them and listen to their opinions. Please also announce to offer the making cost of the new uniform to make it a success.\\nI hope you would find my suggestions helpful.\\nYours faithfully,\\nElizabeth Gomez\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 3.19 (13 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nGT Writing Task 1\\nFormal Letter\\nOfficial-letter\\nLetter Writing Sample\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\n×\\nReport\\nReport\\nClose"]'::jsonb,
