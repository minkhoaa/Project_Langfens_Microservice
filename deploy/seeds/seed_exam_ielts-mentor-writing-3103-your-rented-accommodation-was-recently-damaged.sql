I am a tenant at your Yorkshire Apartment Residence, and writing this letter with regard to extensive damages that were caused to my apartment last night because of a bad storm.\\nThis bad storm, accompanied by a heavy downpour of rain continued for a significant period of time and was strong enough to smash the glass windows on the south side of my apartment. As a result, the cold wind has been entering my apartment continuously without any protection. Besides, the broken tree branches from the large tree, next to my apartment, have fallen on the electricity line of my apartment, and it has been continuously disrupting the electricity connection to my house since last night. As you know that such electricity disturbances can damage some of the electrical appliances, which I use at my apartment, anytime.\\nTherefore, I would like to request you to send some maintenance or repair person to replace the smashed windows as soon as possible before my family freezes in cold. Please also contact the local electricity authority to move the broken trees off the electricity connection line to my apartment.\\nIn case you need my assistance in any way, please just give me a call.\\nYours sincerely,\\nPhil Lawrence\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 4.78 (9 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nGT Writing Task 1\\nSemi-formal Letter\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\nSabrina Qamar\\n7 years 8 months\\nThe same letter came in my IELTS in February 2018.
