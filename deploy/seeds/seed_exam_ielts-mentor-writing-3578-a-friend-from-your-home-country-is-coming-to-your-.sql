  E'["Dear Shrity,\\nI’m so excited that you’ll be visiting me in Adelaide this coming March. I’ve made many plans for us, and I’m eagerly waiting for your arrival. We haven’t seen each other for ages and I hope you had been great during this time. I have a favour to ask you, and I hope it wouldn’t be a burden for you.\\nI’d really appreciate it if you could meet my mother before flying to Australia as I’d want you to bring a couple of items for me. The first thing is a woollen cardigan that my grandmother made for me. It has some sentimental values both for my grandmother and me. My mother would also give you a couple of books – don’t worry, they are not heavy. I need those books to complete a thesis. I couldn’t find them here. Finally, my mother would also give you a tin jar that will contain some homemade cookies and delicacies that my mother used to prepare me in my childhood. They also have emotional and sentimental values both to me and my mother.\\nI do hope that it''ll not cause you any problem. In the meantime, send me your travel itinerary so that I can plan to receive you at the airport. We''ll take a taxi and directly get back to my apartment.\\nI can’t wait to see you and spend some quality time as friends.\\nHave a safe flight.\\nYours truly,\\nSusmita", "Dear Bijoy,\\nI can''t express how excited I really am to learn that you''ll come to Vienna just a week later. It seems ages since we last saw or talked to each other, and there is a lot we need to catch up with. I''m looking forward to meeting you soon, and I also have a favour to ask.\\nI''d like you to meet my parents before you pack your luggage as my parents are going to give you some things for me. Don''t worry, they are just a couple of small items, and I hope they wouldn''t cause you much trouble or add much weight to your luggage. The first thing is a photo album that contains some of our family pictures. This has sentimental value to me as it contains some photos from my childhood when my grandparents were alive. The second and final item is a jar of homemade cookies that my mother made for me. She makes those cookies just before my birthday each year. After I came to Austria, she did the same for the last two years but could not send those to me. I’ve told some of my classmates here how delicious the cookies are, and they''re very keen to try them! And I''m sure my mother would be very delighted if she can send it to me.\\nI do hope that it''s manageable for you, and won''t cause you much trouble. I’m very excited to meet you soon. I can meet you in the evening on any Sunday. Just let me know when you''re free. You''ve my mobile number, so just call me or send me a text.\\nYours truly,\\nAnil\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 4.71 (12 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nGT Writing Task 1\\nInformal Letter\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\nKanwal\\n3 years 11 months\\nDear Sara,\\nI have received your letter a couple of days ago in which you have mentioned that your date of arrival in Sydney is just a week away. I am excited that we are going to meet after years. I have a small favour to ask from you.\\nIt has been more than five years since I last visited Pakistan. I wish I could visit my home country more frequently! Before you leave for Sydney, please visit my home. I am out of fancy festive dresses, and I talked to my mom about that, and she had already purchased a couple of party dresses for me from Zobi''s Boutique. Could you please bring those outfits for me when you come to Sydney? I hope it would not be a big problem for you.\\nI have to attend a few events in the community where everyone likes to wear traditional dresses. So I am desperately hoping to get those dresses that my mom has already bought for me.\\nI will leave you a text shortly; just save my contact number. Also, please give me a call when you land. I would like to invite you to dinner at my place.\\nHave a safe flight.\\nTake Care,\\nYour Friend\\nAsma\\nReply\\nQuote\\n×\\nReport\\nReport\\nClose"]'::jsonb,
