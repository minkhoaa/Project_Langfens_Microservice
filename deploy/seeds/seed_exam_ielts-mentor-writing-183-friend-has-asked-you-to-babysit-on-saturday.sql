  E'You should spend about\n20\nminutes on this task.\nA friend has asked you to babysit on Saturday and wants to know how much you charge per hour for this. Unfortunately, you already have a commitment this weekend and cannot help. However, you are free the following weekend.\nWrite a letter to your friend explaining that you are not able to help this time, but could help later. Also, explain what your fee for the service is.\nWrite at least\n150\nwords.\nYou do\nNOT\nneed to write any addresses.\nBegin your letter as follows:\nDear ....................,\nSample Answer 1:\nDear Bella,\nHope you are doing fine and enjoying the season. I am so happy that you asked me to babysit Anna for you. She is such an adorable child and I love spending time with her. I would be happy to babysit her for you but due to my exam at the university the next Monday, I am afraid I cannot spare time on Saturday. However, I will be free the next week and would be happy to look after her if you want.\nI will be horribly busy studying this whole week and during the weekends as I have an important exam next Monday. My term final result will depend on this exam and I have to dedicate my time to prepare for it. I hope you understand that I cannot spare time before my exam even after I wish I could. However, I will be free the next weekend and would like to babysit for you in case you go out then.\nAs I remember, I charged you 20 dollars an hour last time and the charge would be the same this time as well. In case you need my service for more than 8 hours a day, you should inform beforehand.\nWith lots of love.\nYours truly,\nEmma',

  E'["Dear Bella,\\nHope you are doing fine and enjoying the season. I am so happy that you asked me to babysit Anna for you. She is such an adorable child and I love spending time with her. I would be happy to babysit her for you but due to my exam at the university the next Monday, I am afraid I cannot spare time on Saturday. However, I will be free the next week and would be happy to look after her if you want.\\nI will be horribly busy studying this whole week and during the weekends as I have an important exam next Monday. My term final result will depend on this exam and I have to dedicate my time to prepare for it. I hope you understand that I cannot spare time before my exam even after I wish I could. However, I will be free the next weekend and would like to babysit for you in case you go out then.\\nAs I remember, I charged you 20 dollars an hour last time and the charge would be the same this time as well. In case you need my service for more than 8 hours a day, you should inform beforehand.\\nWith lots of love.\\nYours truly,\\nEmma", "Dear Margarita,\\nThank you for asking me to babysit for you. I must say that I relish looking after Della and would be happy to help you out. She is such a sweet kid. However, this weekend my parents will be with me and I cannot spare time. I am hoping you would understand the situation and allow me to look after Della the next week - if needed.\\nMy parents are coming to visit me next Friday and I am going to take them to some interesting places in the town. They scarcely visit me so I would like to spend as much time as possible with them. Also, my father''s birthday is on next Monday, and I want to celebrate this special occasion with them. I am really sorry that I am not able to help this time, but I am free next weekend and I would be glad to babysit for you then if you should choose to go out for the day.\\nMy charge is twenty dollars per hour until midnight and thirty dollars per hour after that. You would need to give me any special instructions you might have and, of course, leave a phone number in case of emergency.\\nWarm regards,\\nAnna Lechner", "Dear Elena,\\nHope you are doing great and I am excited to read about all your recent news. I have received your message, asking me to help you babysit your little daughter on coming Saturday. I really appreciate the fact that you have actually cared to think of me as a suitable babysitter to look after your little daughter, but I regret to inform you that despite my best intention, I won’t be able to help you this coming weekend.\\nIn fact, this coming weekend, I have already made plans to visit one of my younger cousins in another city because she is going to celebrate her 21st birthday. By the way, my cousin is a bit emotional person, and cancelling the programme to visit her would certainly make her upset.\\nSo, again, I am really sorry that I won’t be able to help you out this coming weekend, but please rest assured that I would be able to help you out the following weekend. By the way, I charge hourly, and the hourly rate is 200 Rouble (Russian). But, please trust me, the rate of charge wouldn’t be an issue when I babysit your daughter.\\nWarm wishes,\\nAnna Irina\\nMore helpful resources:\\nBand 8/9 IELTS Letter Samples with tips to reach this level\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 4.38 (13 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nGT Writing Task 1\\nInformal Letter\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\nSunny Arora\\n6 years 7 months\\nDear Dhiraj,\\nI am writing with regards to your request to babysit for you this Saturday, but unfortunately, I''m preoccupied with some prior commitments and would like to offer the same for next week, if required.\\nFirstly, let me thank you consider me for babysitting \\"Sana\\". She’s a lovely child, and I''d have loved to take this opportunity to spend time with her, but this Saturday is my Grand Mother’s 80th birthday, and we are celebrating it on a grand scale to make it memorable. Moreover, I''ve promised to be with her that day and bake a chocolate truffle cake for her.\\nI apologise for this week. But do let me know if I can be of help next weekend.\\nAs for the charges, it would be 20 dollars an hour same as previous occasions.\\nWarm regards\\nArora\\nReply\\nQuote\\nVinit\\n10 years 5 months\\nDear Magi, I am very pleased to hear from you, after a long time. Much happier to know that you are blessed with a baby. But I am afraid I won’t be able to make it for babysitting this Saturday. As you know my daughter is studying in British national school, I have been intimated about the parents meeting to be conducted on this Saturday. I need to be there for the whole day as my husband would be engaged with his business schedules. However I am very much on to babysitting as a part time job, and much appreciated by my clients for the same. I will be pleased to render my service from next week at your convenience. With a prior notification from your side, I can exclude engagements if any, next weekend. Though I charge around 15 $ per hour for other clients, you being my friend I can offer you a discount rate of 10$ per hour. Hoping to hear from you soon Thanking you Affectionately yoursBrinda.\\nReply\\nQuote\\n×\\nReport\\nReport\\nClose"]'::jsonb,
