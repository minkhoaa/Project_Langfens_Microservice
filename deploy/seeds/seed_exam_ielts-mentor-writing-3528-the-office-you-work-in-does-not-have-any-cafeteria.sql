  E'["Dear Sir or Madam,\\nHope I did not catch you at a busy time since I am sure that you have many other important priorities at work to take care of. But, the issue, I want to raise here, is also equally important for our office staff.\\nThe reason for which I am writing this letter is that our office does not have any cafeteria for its staff where they can go and sit to enjoy some snacks, drinks and food. Now, this would not really be much of an issue if they did not have to walk about 10-12 minutes to grab something for them when they need something to eat or drink during their short breaks and thus collectively waste many important work hours. Besides, going out like this just to get some snacks or get a cup of coffee is rather inconvenient for us, especially, when the weather condition is not favourable.\\nTherefore, I would like to request you to set up a staff cafeteria in the large empty room at the corner of our office, which remains unused most of the time. That will make sure that our staff have at least one less issue to worry about when trying to be more productive and efficient at work.\\nI hope you will consider the issue and arrange to set up a cafeteria soon. Thank you in advance.\\nYours faithfully,\\nAndrew Jones", "Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI am writing this letter to you to forward my suggestion for opening a cafeteria of our own in our office premises.\\nOur employees face severe inconvenience due to the lack of a cafeteria on our office premises. To begin with, we have strict deadlines to adhere to for most of the projects and employees often need coffee or tea breaks. But, the lack of a cafeteria service forces them to walk across the road. They often complain that it kills their valuable time. Moreover, some of our employees, who bring food from home, are forced to eat their lunch on staircases - which is not a pleasant experience for them.\\nI believe we need to have a cafeteria of our own so that our employees do not waste their time by going back and forth to a cafeteria that is located across the road. I also feel that we need to offer a suitable place to our employees so that they can enjoy their lunch.\\nTherefore, I would recommend a snack bar and a cafeteria in our company''s recreational area that can accommodate more than 25 people at a time and serve snacks and drinks. We can hire a couple of staff for the canteen so that they serve the need of our employees. This place will also work as a stress-relieving area where employees can relax over a cup of coffee.\\nI hope you would consider my suggestions.\\nYours faithfully,\\nMichael Arlen\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 4.62 (21 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nGT Writing Task 1\\nFormal Letter\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\nAjaypal Singh Gill\\n4 years 8 months\\nHi, I am confused because the task 1 letter says \\"Dear Sir or Madam\\" instead of the Manager''s name, which confirms that the letter is Formal. However, as an employee, I know the manager well which means the letter is Semi-formal as I can use the Manager''s name instead of Dear Sir/Madam.\\nReply\\nQuote\\nAdam Hense\\n4 years 8 months\\nYou should follow the instruction that the letter question gives. In this case, it says, \\"begin your letter as Dear Sir or Madam\\". So it is definitely a formal letter.\\nTo further eliminate your doubt, in a small company where only a few people work, each employee knows who their manager is and who their higher managements are. However, in many large companies, where thousands of people work, many employees often do not know who their higher managements are, who their managers are and who would be reading their emails or letters they are writing. That is why they address the letter as \\"Dear Sir or Madam\\" and use formal expressions in it. They can''t say if it would be read by their immediate manager or someone other than the manager.\\nReply\\nQuote\\nKunal Chavda\\n4 years 11 months\\nDear Sir or Madam,\\nI am writing to request you to set up a small cafeteria in our office for the convenience of our employees. To give you an idea, most of our employees have relocated from their hometown to this city. Thus, it becomes difficult for them to prepare their meals. Some end up eating junk food while many even skip their breakfasts or lunches. Finally, a group of employees drive almost 30 minutes to have lunch. This is counter-productive and waste of energy and time.\\nIt seems that these people are not having appropriate meals, which is alarming, and it might affect their health and productivity. As a team leader, I would be wanting my team members to be salutary and productive enough. So, it would be great if we can set up a cafeteria for our staff at our company premises, where healthy breakfast and afternoon meal can be served.\\nPlease, let me know if we can take these suggestions forward. Then I can get some proposals from vendors and present to the management.\\nLooking forward to hearing from you.\\nYours faithfully,\\nKunal Chavda\\nReply\\nQuote\\nTrisha Chetani\\n4 years 11 months\\nDear Sir or Madam,\\nI am Trisha Chetani writing this letter to inform you about the difficulty our staffs are facing due to the lack of a cafeteria in our office premises. I hope you would take initiatives so that a cafeteria is established in our office.\\nTo embark with, I have come across many employees in our office during the last few weeks, who are working for eight to ten hours at a stretch without having sufficient lunch breaks as we have a major software release target next March. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, most of them can not bring lunch from home. They can not go out and have lunch as they did in the pre-COVID days either.\\nI am one of the sufferers and I feel bad for all the employees who are having trouble due to the pandemic and the lack of our own cafeteria. The employees are putting hard work and dedication and their first priority is the successful release of the software. So if they are forced to work long hours without having lunch or some fresh cup of coffees, that would hamper their performance.\\nI would appreciate it if we can have some healthy foods and drinks at our cafeteria, which is specially made for staffs. There is available space on the 9th floor, which is not used by any of the teams. We can use this space in particular because there is an open terrace, and our colleague will have a change in mind and place.\\nLooking forward to your support regarding this.\\nYours faithfully,\\nTrisha Chetani\\nReply\\nQuote\\n×\\nReport\\nReport\\nClose"]'::jsonb,
