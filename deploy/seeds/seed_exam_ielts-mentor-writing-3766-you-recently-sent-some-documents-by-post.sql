  E'["Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI am writing this letter to enquire about a postal mail, containing some important documents, which I sent about 16 days ago. Since it is yet to reach its destination, I am hoping that you would help me locate and retrieve it.\\nWith regards to the mail, I sent it on Monday, last 24th October, and it was supposed to arrive at its destination within 5 working days. But, unfortunately, 12 working days have already passed, and the recipient is yet to receive the documents. Of course, a few days ago, I contacted your office and provided them with the mail tracking number, but all they could say at that time was that the mail was picked up the very next day from your post office and had already reached its final destination.\\nThe documents included the original birth certificate, a filled-up form, and name correction documentation of my younger brother, without which he can not get his international passport renewed on time.\\nSo, if you please have someone contact the concerned personnel in the post office at the other end, where the mail is supposed to arrive, to retrieve the documents at the earliest, I will really appreciate it.\\nYours faithfully,\\nDavid Gregory\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 3.44 (8 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nGT Writing Task 1\\nPersonal Letter\\nletter to a friend\\nLetter Writing Sample\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\nDarpan Patel\\n1 year 5 months\\nLetter Question:\\nYou recently sent some documents by post, but they did not arrive at the destination.\\nWrite a letter to the post office manager.

These documents were enclosed in a blue folder and sent via your standard international delivery service, which, according to your policy, guarantees delivery within 15 working days. However, it has now been over three weeks, and the package has still not arrived.\\nI kindly request that you investigate the matter urgently by tracking the parcel’s current location and updating me on its status. If it has been misplaced or delayed, I would appreciate it if you could arrange express delivery to the recipient’s address. I am willing to pay any additional charges that may apply.\\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response.\\nYours faithfully,\\nDarpan Patel\\nReply\\nQuote\\n×\\nReport\\nReport\\nClose"]'::jsonb,
