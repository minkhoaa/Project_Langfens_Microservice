  E'["Dear Mike,\\nI haven’t heard from you in a while. So, how are you?  By the way, do you still like my car? Well, I''m asking because I''m actually planning to sell my current car, which you''ve always liked, and I thought that I''d rather sell it to you instead of some strangers.\\nI''ve decided to purchase an SUV car as I need to frequently travel to my grandmother''s house where the roads are a bit bumpy. So I would sell my current sedan car and go for an SUV.\\nWith regard to the car I want to sell, it''s still in good condition, even though I''ve driven it for almost 2 years. In fact, its engine is still very smooth, with almost no sound when it starts, while its air conditioning system is also very much intact. Besides, you''ll hardly find any scratch on its shiny exterior. And as for its interior, I have recently changed all the seat covers of my car, so it essentially looks like new.\\nI guess that you''ve already got some sort of ideas about the condition of my car from my description, but if you''re really interested to buy this car, please better drop by my house sometime next week and see the car yourself.\\nWarm wishes,\\nAnderson\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 4.93 (7 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nGT Writing Task 1\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\nOmar El Mogharbel\\n5 years 5 months\\nDear John,\\nHope you are doing well. Recently I''ve decided to sell my Toyota Camry 2015 model car and I recall you have always admired this automobile. So, I thought of informing you before posting an advertisement online.\\nI’ve decided to sell this car because I am going to move to Canada permanently within the next five to six months. I will possibly purchase a new automobile there and I see no reason to take my old car with me.\\nThe car is in excellent condition in all aspects. Since I got it just 5 years ago, I have never missed routine check-ups and maintenance schedules. Moreover, no major parts of the car have been changed so far; only brakes and filters have been replaced. And most importantly, I never had an accident with this car and the mileage of the car is less than 70,000 miles.\\nYou are welcome to come and see the car and check it by yourself. If you are interested, just let me know the time that suits you, and we will manage it.\\nPlease do write back. All the best!\\nWarm wishes,\\nOmar\\nReply\\nQuote\\nJaya Gera\\n5 years 5 months\\nDear Tony,\\nI hope you are doing excellent. I''m writing to let you know that I''ve decided to sell my car, the one you have always admired, and I think it would be a good purchase for you.\\nI have always been interested in moving to Vancouver, British Columbia because of the warmer climate of the province. Fortunately, I have recently been promoted to the position of regional manager and I am shifting with my family to Vancouver next August. The company is offering me a car and a house, and therefore, I am selling my car.\\nWith regard to the make and condition of the car, it is a 2012 Toyota Cambri. As you know, it is a well-maintained, single-seater vehicle with a mileage of 200,000 Kilometers. The tires were changed last summer, so they are basically new. Besides, the wipers and spark plugs of the car were recently renewed, hence they are good for another 3 to 4 years. I take the car for servicing every 6 months, so I believe no repair work is required.\\nAs you have always admired my automobile, I would like to invite you to my house on this coming Sunday, anytime after 4:00 pm to come and have a look at it and see if you would like to purchase it. We can decide on a price later on. Once, we are done checking out the car we can have a couple of beers and order in some dinner.\\nLooking forward to hearing from you.\\nJaya\\nReply\\nQuote\\n×\\nReport\\nReport\\nClose"]'::jsonb,
