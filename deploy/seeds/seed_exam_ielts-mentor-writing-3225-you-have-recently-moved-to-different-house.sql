  E'["Dear Charlotte,\\nI''m writing to let you know that at last, we''ve moved to a bigger house! We just couldn''t go on living in the two-bedroom bungalow now that the twins are growing up and the new baby has arrived. So we started looking - and one thing led to another and finally, here we''re in our new home.\\nI''m sure you''ll like it. We have three bedrooms now and a very modern bathroom and kitchen. The kids are happy because there is more space with the big living room and the garden outside. But John is the happiest of all because he doesn''t need to do much decorating.\\nWhy don''t you come round this weekend and see what you think of our new place? We would all love to see you. If the weather is favourable, we can even have a barbecue in the garden.\\nOur new address and phone number are below, so give us a call and let us know when to expect you.\\nWith lots of love,\\nJulia", "Dear Emily,\\nI hope you are doing great. I''m writing this letter to share some exciting news - I''ve recently moved to a new house, and I wanted to let you know about it.\\nThe main reason for my move was to find a more spacious and peaceful environment. My previous apartment, though convenient, felt quite cramped, and the surrounding area was often noisy. This new place offers a much-needed change, allowing me to enjoy a better quality of life.\\nYou''d be glad to know that my new home is a beautiful detached house located in Ottawa, Canada. It has three bedrooms, a modern kitchen, and a lovely backyard with a small garden. The neighbourhood is quiet and safe, with plenty of parks and cafés nearby. It truly feels like the perfect place to settle.\\nI''d love you to visit and stay for a while. Let me know when you can make the trip. I’ll be delighted to show you around!\\nWarm wishes,\\nSophia", "Dear Peter,\\nI haven’t heard from you in a while, and I hope that you are doing well with your life. I just wanted to let you know that I''ve moved to a new house. And the reason, for which, I''ve moved to a new house is that I was feeling suffocated in my old house due to many high rising buildings which were erected around my house, essentially covering it from all directions.\\nI think that I''ve moved to a nice house because there are plenty of empty spaces around it. Besides, my new house is bigger than the previous one, and it has such a great structure that it receives enough natural light and air from all directions as long as they are available. However, the best thing about my new house is that it is close enough to the shopping centres and public transportation facilities, and yet far enough at the same time from the noises of a busy city.\\nAnyway, I think you''ll really like my new house, so come and visit me sometime!\\nWarm wishes,\\nRahul\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 4.40 (39 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nGT Writing Task 1\\nInformal Letter\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\nRivvy\\n2 years 5 months\\nWhat comments!\\nReply\\nQuote\\nIfunanya\\n4 years\\nDear Remi,\\nHow are you doing? I missed you the last time you visited my city. I hope that next time, you''ll inform me in advance so that I can manage time to accommodate you. Also, you''ll be very impressed when you hear how fluently I speak the second language after you helped me with that.\\nI am writing to inform you that I’ve moved to a new apartment. I made this decision when my previous landlord increased my rent and there were no plans to renovate the building after I complained about the poor drainage system and outdated bathroom infrastructure.\\nCurrently, we are living in a newly built three-bedroom apartment. The architecture and design are topnotch with better infrastructure compared to the previous house. In fact, the building is situated very close to the road for easy commuting, and we have access to 24-hour electricity and clean water.\\nI would like to invite you to visit my new home when you are on holiday. I can’t wait to explore my new city with you.\\nCheers,\\nLadi\\nReply\\nQuote\\n×\\nReport\\nReport\\nClose"]'::jsonb,
