  E'["Dear Sir or Madam,\\nMy name is Carl Puran, and I have recently moved to the neighbourhood of Old Spandau. I am writing this letter to get some information about your sports centre.\\nI have been either a member of a sports club or gym wherever I have lived because you can say, I am very health conscious. So, after moving into this new neighbourhood, naturally, I felt the need to join a sports club or gym; and then found out about your sports club which is located very near where I live. Apart from this convenient distance, I would like to join your club also because the majority of the members of this club are of my age, or at least, that is what I have heard. So it would be easier for me to relate to them or befriend a few of them. But, most importantly, your sports club remains open during the weekends also when I usually have more time to enjoy the club activities.\\nBut, before I join your club, I have a couple of questions. Does the club have any children’s playground since I would bring my child with me also, sometimes? And, how much is the cost of membership?\\nI am looking forward to hearing from you soon.\\nYours faithfully,\\nCarl Puran", "Dear Sir or Madam,\\nMy name is Derek Galvin, and I am writing to express my interest in joining your esteemed sports club, SportHub and Fitness Centre. I have recently moved to the neighbourhood and am eager to become a part of the local sports community. I am hoping that you would kindly answer a couple of my answers and help me join there.\\nI am particularly drawn to your sports club because of its reputation for providing high-quality facilities and a welcoming atmosphere. As someone who values physical fitness and enjoys participating in various sports activities, I believe that joining your club would not only help me stay active but also allow me to meet like-minded individuals in the community. I have also heard that a good number of employees from our company already have your membership.\\nBefore I proceed with my membership application, I would appreciate it if you could provide me with some additional information about the club. Firstly, I would like to inquire about the range of facilities available, including any sports equipment, training areas, and locker rooms. Secondly, could you please outline the membership options and associated costs? Lastly, I am curious to know if the club offers any group classes or personalized training sessions.\\nThank you for considering my inquiries, and I look forward to your response.\\nYours faithfully,\\nDerek Galvin\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 3.92 (51 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nGT Writing Task 1\\nFormal Letter\\nInquiry Letter\\nLetter Writing Sample\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\nSiyuan\\n1 year 1 month\\nDear Sir or Madam,\\nI hope this email finds you well.

It must be very popular because there are a lot of people every day.\\nMay I ask you a few details about the clubs? I hope to know more about it before I join. My questions are the following:\\n1.\\thow many courts we can use in the club?\\n2.\\twhat is the open time of the club on weekdays and weekends?\\n3.\\tAre there any requirements to be a member of the club?\\n4.\\tWhat is the cost to get the membership?\\nI look forward to your response.

I am eager to join your well-known sports club and would like to have some information before I proceed with joining the club.\\nFirst, please let me give you some information about me. I relocated to this neighbourhood as my wife was obliged to change her job. Though it has an impact on my job, it is less intense than hers. In my old city, I used to go to the best club. So when I decided to move here, the first question I asked the house agents was \\"Will I get a nice club?\\" They told me that I could get a club which is not far from my new home.\\nWhen I saw your club from the outside, it gave me a good first impression. The advert that has been placed outside would easily attract anyone. Then I decided to see the interior of the club. After that, I have decided to ask you a question before I proceed with joining it.\\nSo, I would like to request you to provide me with more information regarding whether the club has enough showering places as well as having facilities for children as my 12-year-old son would like to accompany me sometimes.\\nI am looking forward to your response. Thank you in advance.\\nYours faithfully,\\nBiniyam Girma\\nReply\\nQuote\\nSusitha\\n1 year 7 months\\nI''m an IELTS student.\\nReply\\nQuote\\nJasan Pandya\\n1 year 10 months\\nDear Sir or Madam,\\nI am writing this letter in regards to enquire more information about getting admission into your sports centre.\\nI am Jasan Pandya, 27 years old, moved to this neighbourhood a week ago. I have been playing cricket since my childhood and I have been part of a local gym club in my county and would like to join here as well. As an IT employee, my daily activity is barely 1000 steps and the reason I am eagerly waiting to join this club is to get some activity started.\\nBut, before I join this club, I have a few questions. How many sports are being played here and also the age limit\\nto play all of them. Does the club have a shower? And, what will be the membership cost? Finally, I would like to know how to get started with one of your memberships.\\nThank you in advance. I am looking forward to hearing from you soon.\\nYours faithfully,\\nJasan Pandya\\nReply\\nQuote\\nThanh Trúc\\n2 years 5 months\\nDear Sir or Madam,\\nMy name is Lu Tiew, and I have recently moved to the town - about 3 weeks ago. I am writing this letter to get some information about your sports centre.\\nI want to join some courses in your sports centre but I do not have any information about them. Yesterday, I saw a woman who got out of your sports centre, and she provided me with some information about your fitness centre. So I want to sign up to participate in your sports centre.\\nI also have a few requests before I join your sports centre:\\nFirstly, your centre must have a complete training kit for the courses. Second, there must be a swimming area and badminton court. I hope you can provide those facilities. Please inform me about their availability.\\nAlso, please suggest any courses that would be good for me. The cost of the course does not bother me. I am not sure if the centre welcomes animals because I am raising a puppy right now.\\nThat is all. I hope I can get an answer from you soon.\\nYours faithfully,\\nLu Tiew\\nReply\\nQuote\\nMeenakshi\\n2 years 8 months\\nI want to join you.\\nReply\\nQuote\\nShohruh\\n2 years 9 months\\nDear Sir or Madam,\\nI am writing to you to get some information regarding your sports club as I am interested in joining it. I hope you would help me with the information at your earliest.\\nI am Shohruh Chinmirzayev, and I am 18 years old. I came to the village one week ago. That time I noticed your sports centre and got interested to join in it. Yesterday, I saw a man who got out of your sports centre, and he provided me with some information about your fitness centre. Now, I want to join some courses in the centre. But I do not know enough about your centre.\\nTherefore, if you provide me with some information, I would be grateful to you. The cost of the course does not matter to me. But you have to tell me about the available courses. I want to join as a beginner. Which facilities do you have in your sports club? Some facilities are important to me like the swimming pool and the tennis court due to my interest in those activities.\\nPlease do not hesitate to contact me any time you want.
