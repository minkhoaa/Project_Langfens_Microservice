  E'["Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI am a resident of the Alperton, London area, writing to request you to reconsider your decision to close the sport and leisure centre we have in our community. I am hoping that you would weigh the utility of this centre before shutting it down.\\nAs you know, we have more than 8 thousand members in our community and only two such leisure and sporting centres. When we are expecting another recreational centre for the benefit of the community members, the decision to shut down the ''Innercircle Sports & Leisure Centre'' was some shocking news for us. I and my father go to this place to do our daily exercise. Besides, I have noticed many children play there in the evening and local people spend a significant amount of time there. Many teenagers have chosen this place to play some indoor games and spend quality time.\\nIf this place is closed, people would feel dejected and I personally worry that the teenagers who use this centre would get involved in subversive activities. This is not at all accepted. If cutting the cost is the only reason to close this centre, I am sure there are alternatives. I have talked to several other members and all of them are against closing this place.\\nPlease do reconsider your decision for the betterment of our community.\\nYours faithfully,\\nPatrick Stuart", "Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI am writing to express my utmost concern regarding the proposed closure of the Maplewood Sports and Leisure Centre. As a regular user, I strongly believe that shutting it down would have significant negative consequences for the local community.\\nMy family and I frequently visit this sports and leisure centre for various activities. My children attend swimming lessons twice a week, while my friends and I use the gym and indoor courts for badminton. The centre has been an integral part of our routine, helping us stay active and healthy.\\nThe issue with closing this facility is that it plays a crucial role in promoting fitness and social well-being in the community. It provides affordable access to exercise, which is particularly important for families, students, and elderly residents who may not be able to afford private gyms. It is also a place that fosters community bonds and upholds our social interactions.\\nIf the centre shuts down, many people will struggle to find alternative fitness options, leading to a decline in public health and an increase in social isolation. I urge the council to reconsider its decision and explore alternative cost-saving measures that do not deprive the community of such an essential resource.\\nI hope you will consider my appeal not to shut down the centre for the overall benefit of the community and its members. Thank you in advance.\\nYours faithfully,\\nEmma Richardson", "Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI am writing this letter to express my serious concern about the recent decision by the local council to close ‘Grapevine Sports and Leisure Centre’ for the lack of funds. Well, while I understand that the decision has been taken in the greater interest of the citizen of Grapevine, I don’t think they fully endorse the idea because closing the sports and leisure centre would deeply affect the physical and mental well-being of our neighbourhood in the long run.\\nMy family, friends and relatives come to this sports centre almost on a regular basis for various physical and social activities. We play badminton, we swim there, and we also use this facility to share our thoughts and opinions with other members of the community. Besides, this facility is also used by our children as their playground during the evening after their school hours. And, ultimately, because of this close bond among the members of our community, our neighbourhood can consider itself as a safe neighbourhood.\\nSo, based on these benefits of this sports and recreation centre, I request you to keep this centre open until, at least, some alternatives are found.\\nYours faithfully,\\nLara Cunningham\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 4.14 (18 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nGT Writing Task 1\\nFormal Letter\\nLetter Writing Sample\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\nNoemi Martos\\n4 years 9 months\\nAmazing and useful skills!! Thank you!!\\nReply\\nQuote\\nAlex\\n7 years\\nDear Sir/ Madam,I am writing this letter in regard to your decision to close the Star Sport and Leisure Centre near the central park. I would like to request you to reconsider your decision for the benefits of the residents.It was a piece of disappointing news for me, and my friends and family as this was the only place where we usually gather and spend some leisure time after a hectic day in office and school. Many children and youngsters come here to play indoor games and senior citizen spend their time doing some light exercise which they cannot do outdoor.Since this is the only publicly accessible centre where most of our local citizens gather for different activities, I’m worried about your declaration to shut down this place to save money. I am sure there are other alternatives for doing so and you would be more thoughtful to keep it open.It is my humble request to you to rethink your decision, and it would be a great contribution to our local people and for the benefits of their healthy lifestyle.Thank you in advance.Yours faithfully,Jenn ifer Lawrence.\\nReply\\nQuote\\nRac\\n8 years\\nSend me writing samples for IELTS GT.\\nReply\\nQuote\\n×\\nReport\\nReport\\nClose"]'::jsonb,
