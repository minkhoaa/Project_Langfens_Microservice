  E'["Dear Samir,\\nHope you are doing great. I cannot find fitting words to express how excited I am to hear that you will be visiting me next week. I am very much looking forward to having you and spending some quality time together.\\nUnfortunately, on 7th June, the day of your arrival, I have an important meeting in my office and I am expected there early in the morning. I wish I could have been at the train station to receive you. However, do not worry, I will keep the keys to my neighbour, George. He lives in the opposite apartment- B2 and will be expecting you at around 9:30 am. Just tell him that you are my cousin Samir and he will hand over you the keys.\\nFrom the train station, you can hail a taxi and give him my apartment''s address. He will do the rest as the address is quite familiar to taxi drivers. The rent should be anything between 15 to 20 pounds.\\nI will be back at 6.30 pm and will take you to dinner at one of my favourite restaurants. Afterwards, we can walk for a few minutes and meet aunt Lucy who lives nearby.\\nI have so many things to share with you and I plan to do many exciting things together, just like the days in our childhood! Wishing you a safe journey.\\nBest wishes,\\nJames", "Dear Ivan,\\nHope you are doing fine. I am so glad that you are coming to stay with me. But, unfortunately, I will not be able to pick you up from the train station since I will be staying out of the town on that morning for some important work.\\nYou know how the job of a Marketing Director goes. But, please don’t you worry because I have requested my landlady to hand you over the keys to my apartment as soon as you come. Besides, I will be back at my apartment on that same day during the evening time.\\nAnd as soon as I arrive, we both will head to an upscale restaurant to eat our dinner. After that, we will go to a nearby lake which looks gorgeous at night.\\nAnyway, before I end, let me give you the direction to my apartment from the train station. Just take a taxi and ask the driver to take you to “Oaktree village home” and the driver will take you there. It is a popular residential place in the town, and every taxi driver knows it.\\nWarm wishes,\\nLance Jerry\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 4.65 (13 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nGT Writing Task 1\\nPersonal Letter\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\nDoàn Nguyễn\\n4 years 10 months\\nGood.\\nReply\\nQuote\\nSaima\\n5 years 3 months\\nIt''s a really good platform for the students who are preparing for IELTS.\\nReply\\nQuote\\nDaniel\\n5 years 7 months\\nDear Sergio,\\nI am so glad you’re coming to stay with me for a few days. I miss your company, dear cousin, and can''t wait to have you at my house!\\nI am writing to let you know that I will be in my office at the time of your arrival, though you can get my house keys and take rest after a long journey. In addition to this, I am giving you instruction on how to get to my place and I’ve made plans for the evening.\\nHaving to work all day and knowing you’re gonna arrive at my place early in the morning, I will leave my house keys at the mailbox. Since I don’t live far away from the main train station, if you catch the A-354 bus towards Park Village it will roughly take you 15 minutes to get to my house. I hope you do not get lost as you can see I''m not an expert at giving directions.\\nWhat’s more? I will be home before 8.00 pm and I’ll order your favourite pizza for dinner. The Liverpool match will start at 9:00 pm tonight and I am wondering if you would like to watch it together.\\nI can’t wait to see you.\\nWarm wishes,\\nDaniel\\nReply\\nQuote\\nJanaka\\n7 years 10 months\\nDear Sara,I have received your letter and so excited to hear that you will visit me on 15th March. I can not wait to meet you! You have mentioned that you will take a train from Lisbon and reach the Tavira central train station at around 10.00 am. I''d have been delighted to receive you at the station upon your arrival but unfortunately, I''m unable to come to the station because I''ve to attend my IELTS exam on the same day at 9:00 am. However, I will keep the door key and you can find it under the carpet placed in front of the door. You can relax inside the home until I get back. I will keep plenty of food in the refrigerator and do not hesitate to use whatever you need at my home. You may prepare anything you like for the lunch and you will find all the food items in the kitchen. Moreover, you are visiting my new place for the very first time, but you won''t be lost as it is easy to find. Once you reach the station, take a metered-taxi and reach the central library road. Then turn left from the Uzzer Shopping Complex and you can find a two-story building left-side of the road and opposite to it you can find my house. I will SMS you my home address in case you need that.I''ll reach home at around 4.00 pm. I suggest that we would go out for dinner to your favourite Arabic cuisine cafe near the Harvest school. After the dinner, we can enjoy movie at the Novo Cinema. I''m so excited to have you with me. See you soon. Take care.With love,Janaka\\nReply\\nQuote\\nAmina\\n8 years\\nGT Writing Task 1: A family member is coming to stay with you. He/she will be arriving by train in the morning, but you won’t be home until the evening.\\nWrite a letter to your relative. In your letter:\\n- explain the arrangements you have made for him/her to get keys and enter the house\\n- tell your relative how to get from the train station to your house\\n- say when you will be home and suggest what you could do together that evening\\nWrite at least 150 words.\\nAnswer:\\nDear Emin,\\nI am so delighted to hear that you will stay at my place during your stay in the town. It has been long since I last meet you and I miss you so much. However, an urgent meeting will take place next Monday, the day you will arrive, and I will be away from home until 6.00 pm.\\nI will leave my key to the caretaker who stays at the reception area of my apartment. I will have to attend the meeting, so I am afraid I can''t meet you at the station.\\nAfter you reach the station, you should take a bus which stops at the city centre. In case you cannot find it, use Google Maps or ask someone at the train station. The bus stops at 3 stations and you should get off at Kizilay station. The conductor announces every station when they reach there. After you arrive Kizilay, you can call a taxi and go to Aydinlikevler High School. I have already sent you my apartment''s location on your WhatsApp. I will return home soon after the meeting is over.\\nI have some wonderful plans for us for the evening. We can go to a restaurant for dinner and I want to show you a park located near my home.\\nI am looking forward to seeing you.\\nBest Wishes,\\nAmina\\nReply\\nQuote\\nSiva\\n5 years 9 months\\nDear Amina,\\nYou incorrectly addressed one of the questions as your friend reaches your place by plane but the question itself mentions that the place where your friend reaches is the train station. You may lose a band score for this.\\nRegards,\\nSiva\\nReply\\nQuote\\n×\\nReport\\nReport\\nClose"]'::jsonb,
