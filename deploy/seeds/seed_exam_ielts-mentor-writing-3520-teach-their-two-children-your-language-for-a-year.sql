  E'["Dear Mr and Mrs Henry,\\nRecently, I came across an advertisement, in which you have asked for someone from Spain to teach the Spanish language to your two children. I have decided to apply for it because the opportunity would help me meet the cost of running an orphanage in a remote village of the war-torn country in Latin America while also exploring the beautiful continent of Australia at the same time.\\nIn my defence of availing this opportunity, I would like to say that I have a bubbly and easy-going personality which makes it rather easy for me to relate to the children. Besides, I have also done babysitting jobs to help a few relatives of mine to take care of their children and received some formal training on first-hand experience in childcare. I have also finished a diploma in teaching young children because I am passionate about teaching them.\\nIn addition to taking care of your children, I could also prepare some delicious Spanish food and delicacies on some special occasions to surprise your friends and families.\\nI am hoping that you would offer me the job. Thank you in advance.\\nYours sincerely,\\nMaria Lucy", "Dear Mr. and Mrs. Thompson,\\nI recently came across your advertisement seeking a tutor to teach your two children my native language - Spanish, and I would love to apply for the position.\\nAs a qualified Spanish language teacher with five years of experience, I have taught children of various ages and proficiency levels. I focus on interactive and engaging lessons that make learning enjoyable, incorporating games, storytelling, and cultural activities to keep young learners motivated. My approach ensures that children not only learn the language but also develop confidence in using it in daily conversations.\\nIn addition to teaching, I would be happy to assist your family in other ways. I can help with homework, organise educational activities, or even introduce your children to traditional songs and stories from my culture. If needed, I am also willing to assist with light household tasks or meal preparation.\\nI am particularly interested in this role because I have always wanted to experience life in Australia while sharing my language and culture with others. I believe this opportunity would be mutually enriching, and I am eager to contribute to your children’s learning journey.\\nPlease let me know if you would like to discuss this further. I would be happy to arrange a call at your convenience.\\nYours sincerely,\\nLucía Gómez\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 4.88 (8 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nGT Writing Task 1\\nLetter Writing Sample\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\nMuneer Alam\\n4 years 7 months\\nDear Mr. and Mrs. John,\\nMy name is Ahmad Alam, and I am writing to you about your online advertisement regarding Arabic classes for your two children. I would like to offer my services for this job as I am a native Arabic speaker, and quite fluent in English as well.\\nApart from teaching your children, I can also offer my services as a babysitter. I have previous experience of babysitting. I have also taught young children Arabic in school back in my home county. I am pretty confident that I would prove to be a very good Arabic teacher for your children.\\nApart from teaching Arabic, I also have had some experience babysitting in the past. If there are times when you two need to go out together, you may leave the children to me without worrying about anything. I can take great care of them in your absence.\\nStudying in Australia has been a great experience, but it has not come without its due problems. I have sometimes faced financial difficulties in fulfilling my fees or bills. I, therefore, would like to say that I am a deserving candidate as well as a person in need, and I would highly appreciate it if you could offer this job to me.\\nYours sincerely,\\nAhmad Alam\\nReply\\nQuote\\nSamer Omar\\n5 years\\nDear Mr and Mrs Abraham,\\nI am writing with regard to your advert that was published in a daily newspaper a week ago, seeking for an Arabic teacher for your two children. I would like to express my interest to teach your children Arabic, and I believe my abilities and experience are perfectly aligned with this job.\\nBeing a native Arabic speaker and fluent in English, I am passionate about teaching, and these are the primary reasons for which you should hire me. Besides, I have been teaching Arabic as a second language in Australia for more than 10 years. In addition, I have obtained a master’s degree in education from Sydney University. But, which makes me the ideal candidate for teaching your seven and ten years old children is that I love to teach youngsters.\\nI am enthusiastic about teaching, especially when it comes to teaching children. Moreover, I feel connected to my motherland when I teach Arabic. Not to mention, it would give me a source of steady income. I consider myself a deserving candidate and would be indebted to you if you hire me.\\nI look forward to hearing a positive reply from you. I would also be ready to talk to you in details about how and when I can start.\\nYours faithfully,\\nSamer Omar\\n["]'::jsonb,
