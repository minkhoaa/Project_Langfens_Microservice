It was extremely useful, so when I went to visit a friend two days ago, I took the book with me. Unfortunately, I missed the book on the bus. I am hoping you would instruct me on how can I recompensate the lost book.\\nWhen I was on a bus to Darlinghurst, Sydney, I fell asleep and missed my bus stop. I woke up at the next stop and rushed forward to the driver to ask him to stop but forgot to take the book. As a result, the book was left on the bus. When I rang the bus company the next day, they could not find it and suggested that somebody must have picked it up. My library ID is 15478412 and I borrowed the book on 26th November.\\nCould you please let me know what I should do now? As I am an international student and have been facing such an incident for the first time, I am not sure what to do next. But of course, I will be ready to pay for a new copy of the book if this is necessary.\\nYours faithfully,\\nLaura Sian", "Dear Sir or Madam,\\nA few weeks ago, I borrowed a book on how to become an expert in business and professional communication titled, \\"The art of Business and Professional Communication\\" from your library so that I was able to improve my overall knowledge about communication in the corporate world.\\nAnyway, I am really glad that I borrowed that excellent book from your library because it proved out to be extremely useful. In fact, I carried the book with me wherever I would travel during these last few weeks. But, I guess that I shouldn’t have done that because that’s probably the reason I lost it.\\nIn fact, I think that I left the book by mistake on a bus. Of course, I contacted the bus company later on but they said that they didn’t find any book.\\nSo, could you please tell me what I should do now?  By the way, I am an international student, and I do not have that much money with me right now. But, still, I am willing to pay for a new copy of that book if that’s what it takes to remedy the situation.\\nYours faithfully,\\nRashid Khan\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 4.94 (9 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nGT Writing Task 1\\nFormal Letter\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\nVineeth\\n10 years 5 months\\nDear sir, I am Mr Pete, and my membership number is 456 at your library. I am writing in deep sorrow of losing a book borrowed from your library last week. I was travelling in a bus yesterday when owing to a bomb threat the passengers were asked to disperse from the bus on an emergency basis. The bus was running in its full capacity and being said so you could assume the panic a bomb threat would cause, I somehow managed to get out through the emergency exit window, little did I thought at that point of time that I carried a book with me. Later as soon as I realised that I have lost the book loaned from your library, I ranged up the bus station hoping I could retrieve the book, in vain. With no more ways to find the book, I put forward my sincere apology on the awful incident . Now given the situation I would like to enquire on what can be done in such a case of book loss? As you may know, I am an international student here basically surviving on my part time jobs. However, I am ready to bear the expense involved in reviving a copy of the book. Hope you will be kind enough to accept my apologies and consider my request Thanking youSincerelyPet e.\\nReply\\nQuote\\n×\\nReport\\nReport\\nClose"]'::jsonb,
