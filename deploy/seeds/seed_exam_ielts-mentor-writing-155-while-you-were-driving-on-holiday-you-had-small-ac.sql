  E'["Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI have recently rented a car from your Wandsworth showroom in London for a duration of two weeks. Unfortunately, I was involved in a minor accident while driving to Heathrow airport. I am hoping you would go through the report attached to this letter and handle the incident with professionalism as you always do.\\nWith regards to the car that I hired, it is a Honda Civic Hybrid sedan car with the number plate GB LN58RTV. I hired it on 26th May and have paid a week''s rent upfront. I would like to commend your company for their professionalism and the service offered as I have always relied on your service whenever I needed to hire a car.\\nUnfortunately, I had an unavoidable accident involving another party while I was off to the airport to receive my cousin on 2nd June. The accident was caused by the other car failing to stop at the red light at the intersection I was passing through, and as such, the second party collided into the driver''s side of my automobile. The driver of the other car agreed to pay £800 as compensation when I informed the police. The police have recorded information regarding the accident and the other driver’s insurance details. The second party''s insurance company has been informed as well.\\nI would like to request that a replacement vehicle should be offered while my current vehicle is incapacitated. Once again, I would like to commend your company''s professional attitude.\\nYours faithfully,\\nDavid Clark", "Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI have recently rented a Maruti Suzuki Alto car from your company and let me tell you, you have some world-class employees working with you. The quality of the vehicle was top-notch and you provide an impressive service as per my experience. I hired this car a week ago from your Chandigarh office. However, it is a regret that an accident spoiled both my holiday and spirit and caused some damages to the car.\\nI was driving to Kalka station from Chandigarh to pick one of my friends from the railway station when a small accident took place. I was standing at the red light when suddenly another car coming at a very high speed hit my vehicle from behind, leaving the bumper and the silencer of the car somewhat broken.\\nA police officer on duty has lodged an FIR against the other driver, and after checking all the essential documents, he has advised the other driver to bear all the charges for the repairing and servicing of the car. I have reserved this vehicle till 14th March and require it for some important tasks. Hence I sincerely request you to arrange another car for me. I shall be very thankful to you.\\nThank you for giving the matter your attention and I hope to hear your reply soon.\\nYours faithfully,\\nPooja Gupta\\n[", "Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI hired a Maruti Swift Car (Registration Number: MP07 5234) from your city centre outlet, Bangalore, on 12th September for a duration of four days. I am writing to apprise you of a minor accident that involved that car. I am hoping you would take the necessary actions regarding this.\\nI have hired this car for a family holiday in Mysore, but unfortunately, the automobile was involved in a small accident yesterday. As it was dark and in the absence of a street light, I could not notice an open and large pothole on the road on time and applied the brake suddenly. Due to this, the car behind collided with my car. Although there was no major damage, only the light on the left-hand side was broken and had a small dent.\\nThough I have got the light and dent fixed at a Maruti authorised service station, but the small scratches are still visible. Please accept my sincere apologies. I am willing to pay some extra charges as compensation if required. You can send me the final bill to my address and I shall clear all dues within next week.\\nPlease feel free to call me, in case any further information is required.\\nThank you in advance.\\nYours faithfully,\\nPreeti Ghuraiya\\n[", "Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI have hired a Toyota Altis car on 17th August from your head office located at Serangoon, for a period of 15 days. The registration number of the car is SGT 2345D. I am writing to inform you that I have been involved in a minor accident earlier today that caused some damages to the car.\\nI was on my way to my office and at the Raffle city junction, a car from the opposite direction tried to cross the signal when it was red. Due to his rash driving, his vehicle slightly touched the right side of my car. I tried my best to avoid it, but could not help much. The driver side''s rear-view mirror broke and also led to some scratches on the right side of the car. I reported the incident to the on-duty police and he lodged a complaint and informed the other driver''s insurance company.\\nI am attaching the police report to this letter so that you can review what really happened and claim the insurance for the repair costs. But I replaced the rearview mirror from the service station as it is very necessary for driving.\\nI am ready to cooperate regarding this and if you need any further information, I am available at 98765678.\\nYours faithfully,\\nAnkit Gupta", "Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI am writing this letter to report an accident that happened last weekend with the car that I rented a few days ago from your company.\\nI hired a Toyota Inova 2023 model car last Saturday from your Petro branch near the Hilton hotel. I reserved the car for eight days and paid half of the charge upfront. Last Sunday I took a countryside tour to visit Cloud Mountain in the southern city.  When I drove at the end of the express highway leading to Lauren Bridge a car in front of me suddenly turned left without any signal. It happened so swiftly that I could not reduce the speed and control the vehicle properly which caused a collision between us. The left headlight was broken and a few scratched on the left side of the car is visible. Fortunately, none of us was injured. Later we called the police and the incident was reported accordingly.\\nIn the meantime, I sent the vehicle to a repair shop for repair. I obviously will bear all the costs. I expect to have the car returned this Friday as per our contract. I am attaching herein, a copy of the report in which you can find more details about the incident.\\nI apologise for the unexpected inconvenience caused and accept to pay the compensation if any.\\nThank you for your understanding.\\nYours faithfully,\\nJennifer Poulsen\\n["]'::jsonb,
