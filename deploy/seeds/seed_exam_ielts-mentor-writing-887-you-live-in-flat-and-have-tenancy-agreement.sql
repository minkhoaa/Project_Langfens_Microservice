  E'["Dear Mr Milan,\\nI am a tenant of your apartment D#4 in Birmingham Garden street. I am writing to ask a favour from you due to a family emergency and I need to vacate your flat next month - 30th June 2025, to be exact.\\nI have signed an agreement while moving into your flat which bounds me to notify you three months prior to empty the flat. I have always respected the contract and paid my rent on time. During my 11 months'' stay at your falt, I have never asked your favour but this time I am relying on your kind consideration. My elder brother, who looks after our family business, has been diagnosed with a serious disease and has been transferred to a hospital in Manhattan. My family needs me to look after the business and be with them right now.\\nThe circumstance has forced me to give up the training programme that I am pursuing and return home immediately. I have decided to leave England and return to my home country on 2nd June 2025.\\nI, therefore, request you to consider my situation and permit me to vacate your flat on a month''s notice. I have already paid two month''s rent in advance and would request you to return me a month''s rent which is £750. I have always known you as a benevolent person and would not have requested your favour otherwise.\\nYours sincerely,\\nDavid Sergel", "Dear Mr Lucas,\\nI hope that you are in good health and spirit. I am writing this letter because I am in a precarious situation, and I would need your favour.\\nVery recently, I came to know from my father that my younger brother, who suffers from some mental problems from time to time, has suddenly disappeared from home. In fact, he has disappeared for almost a week, but my family and the police have found no trace of him anywhere yet. Not to mention, this incident has made my whole family, including me, very worried, and so I need to stay by their side in these tough times and leave my flat immediately.\\nNow, I understand that I signed a tenancy agreement that says that I would need to give there months’ notice before leaving your flat, but I don’t think that I can actually wait that long.\\nSo, please feel free to keep the deposit of one month and return another month''s deposit to me. And please also consider my situation and do me the favour of not maintaining the proper notice period. However, if you get a tenant in the meantime, I would expect that you would inform me and return my deposit amount.\\nYours sincerely,\\nHenry Lionel\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 3.86 (14 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nGT Writing Task 1\\nSemi-formal Letter\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\nAliakbarian\\n7 years 7 months\\nFamily emergency is correct, not emergency family. And vacant is not a verb, it is an adjective, the verb is ''to vacate''.\\nReply\\nQuote\\nVinit\\n10 years 5 months\\nDear Margarita, I am writing in deep sorrow to inform you that my only son Andrew is severely ill and hence we are leaving for our hometown once and for all. I would request you to settle our tenancy agreement before I exit. As you know we rented your house three years back, all was going well for us from then, until last month when my son Andrew was diagnosed with a benign growth - a suspected brain tumour. As you can assume, our life has turned miserable from that moment. We plan to move back to our hometown seeking more expertise in his treatment. Given the situation, I would request you to kindly settle our contract on house renting. Just letting you know, I paid $10000 as advance prior to occupancy and also would plead you to wave me the three months notice period, as such a day was unexpected. Please let me know when you could return the advance amount so as to facilitate my exit. hope you will consider the circumstances, under which I am requesting such a favor from you and will do the needed full as an act of appeasing.Thanking yousincerelyJon es.\\nReply\\nQuote\\nPankaj\\n10 years 8 months\\nDear Sir/ Madam,I am writing this letter to you as I am stuck in an emergency situation. This is the third year of my tenancy and I have been living in your flat without any issues. I regard you for your high moral values and supports that you have rendered to me so far.I am very sad to say that, my father has been diagnosed with a second stage of blood cancer. I have to stay with him at my home place until his illness is cured. I will require you support in this tough moment of my life. I signed an agreement with you while renting your flat, for which I am supposed to give three months’ notice before I vacant it. I deposited two months’ rent as advance to you. In this most difficult moment, I need your help. Please exempt me from three months’ notice period. Also, understand my urgent need and refund me the advance money that I have paid. Please pray to God for the well-being of my father.Yours TrulyXYZ.\\nReply\\nQuote\\n×\\nReport\\nReport\\nClose"]'::jsonb,
