I also have an account with your bank which I opened after I had arrived in Sweden about 2 years ago. I have always managed to keep my account in good standing. But, today I am writing this letter in order to ask for a short-term loan because I will not be able to receive any money transfer anytime soon due to some errors with my parent''s bank account in my country.\\nOf course, my parents are trying to sort out the problem, but they told me that it would take a while before I receive any bank transfer. But, I will need the money now since I will have to pay my rent within a few days. Besides, I will need to take care of other expenses, like the costs of food and transportation.\\nTherefore, please grant me a loan of 2,000 Euro for a maximum period of three months.  But as soon as I receive the bank transfer from my parents, I surely will pay you back.\\nYours faithfully,\\nWong Lee\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 4.88 (8 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nGT Writing Task 1\\nFormal Letter\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\nSabrina Qamar\\n7 years 5 months\\nDear Sir or Madam,\\nI am writing this letter to you for requesting the approval of a personal bank loan for which I applied a couple of days ago. I will repay the loan in four instalments starting from the next month.\\nI am Angela Bill, currently pursuing an undergraduate course at Kings College, Sweden. My major is \\"Accounting\\", and I have completed my 5th semester recently. I am an account holder of your bank for the past one and a half years. Due to some technical errors in my parent''s bank account in the USA, I am unable to receive my monthly payment this month. And I urgently require $2,000 to pay my accommodation dues.\\nBeing an international student, I do not have any relatives here from whom I can borrow the amount. So, it would be highly appreciable if you sanction my loan as early as possible.\\nI will repay the amount as per your bank guidelines. All my other details are present in your bank.\\nWaiting for your prompt response.\\nYours faithfully,\\nAngela Bill\\nReply\\nQuote\\nIvan\\n7 years 6 months\\nDear Sir or Madam,\\nI am Ivan Kuzmenko, a second-year student at the National University in Sweden. Every month I receive money from my parents, who live in Ukraine. My parents are the clients of your bank but unfortunately, something has happened with the account of my parents and I am left without financial support here in Sweden. Therefore, I would like to know if it is possible for you to lend me two thousand dollars for my monthly fee for my University and my accommodation of the university campus.\\nIt is vital for me because if I am not able to pay the aforementioned monthly fees in due time, I will not be allowed to attend my classes at University. I can assure you that as the client of your bank, as soon as I receive money from my procreators, I will pay back my loan and cover all additional payments including the percentages for using the credit. In addition, I have monthly a stipend of 700 dollars and I can sign a contract for the loan of 2000 dollars with your bank for one year with a monthly payment of 300 dollars, including the loan and percentages of its loan, as the second variant, if the first variant is not suitable for you.\\nI am looking forward to hearing from you.\\nThank you in advance.\\nYours faithfully,\\nIvan Kuzmenko\\nReply\\nQuote\\n×\\nReport\\nReport\\nClose"]'::jsonb,
