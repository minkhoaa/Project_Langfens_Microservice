  E'["Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI am a regular commuter of your bus service - Maple Tree Transportation, and I travelled from Edmonton to Calgary on April 5th. Unfortunately, my new suitcase was completely damaged due to the carelessness of your bus staff and I am writing to claim compensation for that and would request you to investigate the issue so that it does not happen to any other commuter.\\nWith regards to the incident, I took a bus from the Edmonton city station at 2:00 pm and reached the Calgary bus bay at 8:00 pm on 25th February 2025. I checked in a suitcase made by American Tourister and it contained my personal belongings. I instructed the bus staff to handle it with care. Unfortunately, when I arrived at Calgary bus bay and noticed my suitcase, its bottom part was completely torn down. I am sure this happened because someone very forcefully pulled it in and out of the luggage box. On top of that, the left wheel of my suitcase was also broken into pieces. This happened because your bus staff bungled my luggage.\\nMishandling of passengers luggage is not acceptable. My brand new suitcase got vitiated due to inadequate management and disregard of your bus staff. Therefore, I request quick action in this regard and ask for full payment for the damage caused to the suitcase. I am attaching the receipt for the suitcase which I purchased last month. Also, talk to the bus staff so that they do not repeat that incident.\\nAwaiting your reply and expecting immediate action from you.\\nYours faithfully,\\nAndy Odesa\\n[", "Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI am Ethan Deen a regular commuter of your bus. Recently I took your bus to reach Boston and to my surprise, your staff''s mishandling of my luggage caused severe damage to it. I am writing to claim compensation for the property damage while travelling on a bus from your company.\\nI travelled from Washington, D.C. to Boston on bus #301 on April 21, 2025. The bus left the Greyhound Station at 9:30 am. Before the trip, I handed over my luggage to the conductor, who helped me to place my suitcase in the luggage compartment, which was almost empty at that time. After I arrived at the Boston Bus Station, the person in charge opened the compartment and I noticed that my brand new Gucci suitcase was smashed under the pressure of the weight of several other luggage.\\nMy suitcase was firm and very beautiful with its modern design. However, it obviously hasn’t been designed to resist such a weight on it. I am very depressed because I can no longer use this suitcase. Its handle bent and two wheels got detached.\\nSince the damage was caused by the careless actions of your employee, I would like to claim my compensation of $250, which was the original price of my suitcase. Please, deliver a cheque to the address, written above.\\nFaithfully yours,\\nEthan Deen", "Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI travelled from London to Manchester on 20th January 2025 on your bus - M548, and unfortunately, my new suitcase was completely damaged due to mishandling by a staff member on the bus. I''m writing to claim the compensation for the damage while using your service and hoping to hear from you soon regarding this.\\nThe bus I took left London Central Bus Station at 2:00 pm on 20th July and I handed over my suitcase to a bus staff before taking my seat. It is a four-wheel suitcase made by TravelPro and it contained my personal belongings. When I arrived at the Manchester Bus Terminal, I got my suitcase back but to my surprise, its upper part was torn down and two of its wheels were broken. I immediately complained to the bus driver but he didn''t take any action and advised me to write to you instead.\\nI purchased this suitcase only a week ago and the warranty does not cover such forceful physical damage. As your bus staff is responsible for the damage, I am entitled to get proper compensation. I am attaching the invoice for my suitcase and pictures of the damaged suitcase with this letter.\\nI look forward to hearing from you regarding this soon.\\nYours faithfully,\\nMilad Rahimi\\n[", "Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI am Sameed Qureshi, a loyal customer of your bus service, writing to bring your attention to property damage while travelling by one of your buses from Hamburg to Frankfurt on 24th February 2025. I am hoping to receive compensation for the damage and would expect you to issue a show-cause letter to the person responsible.\\nRegarding the incident, I took a bus (number BT5801) on 24th February 2025 and the bus left the Hamburg Central Bus Station at 7:30 am. Like most travellers, I submitted my suitcase to a bus staff who kept it in the luggage compartment. When the bus arrived at the Frankfurt terminal, I was shocked to discover that my suitcase was severely damaged. It was a maroon suitcase that my dad has given me as a present. Hence it has a sentimental value to me. It is an expensive suitcase made by Briggs & Riley company.\\nSince I have submitted the suitcase to one of your employees before embarking on this journey, I expect you to reimburse me the amount equivalent to the fair value of my suitcase. Please find the enclosed purchase receipt of the suitcase. I have already decided that if you fail to pay me for my loss within the next 14 days, I shall institute legal proceedings against your company in a small claims court.\\nI am anticipating immediate remedial action.\\nYours faithfully,\\nSameed Qureshi\\n["]'::jsonb,
