I do not know how much will I be needing to spend with it.\\" 1). Why do we have \\"will\\" in front of \\"I\\"? The structure of the sentence does not look like there should be a question sentence word order. To me, it would sound like \\"I do not know how much I will be... 2). In which situation using \\"needing\\" in continuous tenses is correct? Why is that here?I really appreciate your comments.\\nReply\\nQuote\\nAbd Alwhab Mansur\\n7 years 11 months\\nDear sir/madam,I am introducing myself as an interested in the seminar that you have announced to be held next month in the UK.
