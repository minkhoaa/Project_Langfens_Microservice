  E'["Dear Mr Chen,\\nI am Rona Lyn Olivar, one of the part-time receptionists at your Sea View Hotel. I have been working here since July and I have taken the job to gain some experience that I thought would be helpful for my future career. I am writing to draw your attention to a few issues I have encountered in the hotel. I am hoping that you would take steps to solve these.\\nI have noticed that some of the duty staff at night shift sleep inside the hotel''s quarter instead of being at the reception area. Literally, I and Lindsay- who is also a new employee, work and manage everything at night. They even do not bother to come to the reception area at busy hours when we have an influx of guests - usually on Friday nights. I believe this is against the rules.\\nMoreover, breakfast is supposed to be ready before 7:00 am but it is not the case. Sometimes the guests have to wait till 8:00 am for breakfast to arrive. Some of the guests have lodged complaints regarding this.\\nI thought you should be notified about these irregularities. Duty officers on the night shift should be reprimanded and warned so that they execute their duties. Besides, look at the recent complaints regarding the delay in breakfast serving and talk to the head chef.\\nI look forward to your response regarding this matter.\\nYours sincerely,\\nRona Olivar", "Dear Mr Harris,\\nI am a part-time call centre operator at your company, started working about 4 weeks ago. I am writing to indicate some of the problems I encountered during my work. I am hoping that you would investigate these issues and resolve them.\\nI decided to take the position of telesales specialist because I want to develop a career in the digital sales industry. Besides, it offers flexible timing and does not contradict my class schedule. However, I realised there are some obstacles that need your intervention.\\nThe problems started almost a fortnight ago when the system administrator updated my computer''s operating system. A few days ago, while I was querying a customer for her personal data, my computer restarted and this person’s profile was lost. This occurred several times afterwards. I asked the system administrator to solve it, but he did nothing about it!\\nThe software that manages our calls often deliver far more calls per hour than we can handle. The person in charge did not listen to our request and asked us to contact you.\\nI believe that the system administrator should be show caused due to his negligence and the call-flow should be rational. More calls demotivate us do not mean more sales.\\nSincerely yours,\\nBen Flip", "Dear Mr Patrick,\\nI am working as a part-time computer operator in your office for the last six weeks. I took the job to fund my internship in a software programming course. Today, I am writing to raise some concerns about the problems I facing on the job and hoping your intercession to solve them.\\nI was told at the time of joining that the working hours would be from 2:00 to 6:00 pm. However, I have been working from 2:00 to 10:00 pm for the last couple of days. Unfortunately, the person who is supposed to come at 7:30 pm sharp does not show up until 10.00 pm.\\nMoreover, my supervisor forces me to work on Fridays, which according to my job contract is not mandatory. Although I had managed to work on Friday until the last week by missing a few lectures at college, it seems unmanageable in the future as this will affect my studies.\\nI would really appreciate it if you could talk to our supervisor about these problems and offer me a solution as early as possible. Otherwise, I would have to quit the job, even though I enjoy my work and love working for your company.\\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\\nYours sincerely,\\nRiya Nagpal\\n[", "Dear Mr Anderson,\\nI would like to thank you for giving me the opportunity to work in your company as a part-time cost-benefit analyst. So far I have been enjoying my work but some issues have been raised that need your interference to resolve. I am hoping that you would help me work even more efficiently by solving them.\\nI joined your company on 20th September as a part-timer and gaining experience and supporting my university tuition were my reasons to take a job. My job contract was to work for three days a week. Recently our team lead has instructed me to work four days per week which will contradict my class schedule.\\nBesides, the computer I was given is not suitable to do my work. Despite assurance from the IT department, I am yet to receive a high configuration laptop. In fact, I am using my own laptop to work with the Primavera Software and I am worried about losing project data if some technical problems occur.\\nI hope that I have not raised any irrational complaints and really need your help to work efficiently.\\nYours faithfully,\\nMilad Rahimi\\n[", "Dear Mr Johnson,\\nI am writing to you regarding a few issues related to the job I have taken in your company. I decided to take the job in order to gain some practical experience as a law student but I am afraid some problems deter me to work properly, which is affecting me personally.\\nI understand the job requires me to fill in a minimum of 3 affidavits each day in accordance with the files given by our solicitors. The problem is that the solicitors cannot hand in the files on time. I was told that I should get the files before 10 each morning, but in reality, I never have them before lunch, that is, 1.00 pm. As a consequence, I have to stay up until 10.00 pm almost every day to finish my daily work.\\nSince in theory, our solicitors are supposed to complete their files the day before, I am wondering if it is possible for you to ask them to hand in the files a little bit earlier. I live far away from our firm and have classes from 6.30 in the morning, so working up to 10.00 pm is troublesome for me. I hope you would understand the issue and take steps to solve it.\\nOnce again, thank you for your attention.\\nYours sincerely,\\nVanessa Quan\\n[", "Dear Mrs Jeeni:\\nI have joined your company as a part-time employee a few weeks ago and I am indebted for the opportunity you have bestowed on me. I took the job to finish my internship - which is a requirement to complete my Bachelor degree. However, some challenges are impeding our work performance and I need your help to solve them.\\nDuring this short span of my work, I have noticed some problems that are obstacles to the overall progress of the company. To start with, I help other data analysts with different data from various sources as per the requirement. I have to collect the same data many times. The main reason behind this redundant work is the lack of MIS reporting software and a solid database system. We can avail many benefits by using that type of software. It would both ensure better performance of employees and data security.\\nMoreover, we have to take our lunch outside and this kills our valuable time. Lunch arrange by the office would ensure hygienic meals, and save our time which we could better utilise in the office.\\nTherefore, I request you to implement MIS software for our office, which would be a really prudent investment in the long run. Besides, please arrange lunch for the employees as soon as possible.\\nYours faithfully,\\nSafayet Ullah\\n[", "Dear Mr Lim,\\nI have been working with your company for almost five weeks as a part-time call centre agent. I am writing this letter to raise my concerns regarding some of the problems that I encountered during my work at your company. I am expecting that you would take measures to resolve them.\\nI took the job as I believed it would enhance my communication and public speaking skills and increase my confidence in socialising with other people in an addendum to supporting my studies.\\nDuring the first week, everything went fine. But from my second week, I started facing some unavoidable issues. My computer automatically shuts down and it interrupts my communication with customers. It happened almost every day. After I raised the problem to the technician in charge, he tried to fix it but without success. What I hate most is that the guy is blaming me for not using the computer properly! In addition, I was supposed to be picked up and dropped off every office day, but this is not happening.\\nI am confident enough that the computer problem is not at all my fault, and happens due to the use of pirated software. I am concerned because my overall performance has already been affected by it. It would be easier if a new computer is provided to me or made sure the fix is done properly. Also please try to arrange my transportation, at least to drop me off at the end of the office.\\nI am hoping for your immediate response on this matter.\\nRespectfully yours,\\nChristine Hazel", "Dear Mrs Fischer,\\nI am a part-time Financial Assistant in your office and I joined here almost three months ago. I am honoured to be considered a deserving employee in your reputed organisation. However, I am writing this letter to raise some concerns about the job. I am sure you would probe these issues and solve them.\\nI delightfully took the job to work for an excellent company and I was offered an attractive remuneration. The prospect for improvement and promotion was another reason I joined here.\\nI have signed the contract paper as a part-time employee and my office hours are from 11:00 am to 5:00 pm. But the head of my department always forces me to come before 10:00 o''clock in the morning and this has become quite impossible for me. I have to drop off my son at his school at 8:30 am. I am not sure why the head of the department is ordering me to start office before 10:00 am while he never shows up before 11:00 am?\\nI am also shocked to face the unforeseeable trouble of working until 9:00 pm to finish my scheduled task. Sometimes I have to stay office till late hours while the whole office is deserted.\\nI feel nervous to tell the department head not to force me to come office before 10:00 am. That is why I am notifying you about this problem. I guess I should be given as many opportunities as it is offered to other employees. I can fully devote myself to work harder but something unusual and unreasonable should not be imposed on me. I want your intervene to have this problem resolved.\\nI will be waiting to get a positive response from you.\\nSincerely yours,\\nSudip Pant\\n[", "Dear Mr Lechner,\\nI have been working as a part-time fitness instructor at your gym for the last four months. I am gratified to be offered the job, not only because I need to earn some extra money to cover my living expenses but also because I want to enhance my experience in fitness training. Unfortunately, some impediments in the job force me to ask for your intervention.\\nPeople often need help from instructors in using the gym equipment. However, it seems that other trainers are reluctant in offering assistance to club members. I offer as much as I can, but this means I am constantly in demand and therefore, working harder than anyone else in the gym. This situation seems rather unfair.\\nWhile I realise that members receive initial gym instruction, I feel that they also need ongoing help with the equipment. Could I suggest that a letter is sent to trainers promoting this? After all, the personal attention of this kind makes people feel valued and may result in increased membership.\\nYours faithfully,\\nDonald Green", "Dear Mr Karim,\\nI am writing to raise my concern about some specific problems with respect to my current job. I have been doing a part-time job as a Software Architect in your company for the last two months and have two specific problems which impeded me to work properly. I am hoping you would intervene and resolved these problems.\\nI really like my job and looking forward to working for your company and contribute with my best effort. But sadly, I can not access the Internet and had been restricted to use the office intranet. Frankly speaking, I have never faced it in another company. I completely understand all the securities and policies, but in fact, employees often struggle with different problems during developing new discrete and concrete components in SOA patterns and Googling is the best way to get help and resources. Therefore, I sincerely ask you to allow us to access the Internet.\\nMoreover, I was informed to help the User Interface (UI) team swiftly accomplish their job a few weeks ago. But my current seat arrangement is quite inconvenient to interact with the UI team members as they are on a different floor. Hence, I would appreciate it if you put my seat near the UI development team immediately.\\nI beg your pardon for pointing out issues which sound more like complaints. My sincere apology for that and I am looking forward to hearing from you soon.\\nYours faithfully,\\nAli Khan\\n["]'::jsonb,
