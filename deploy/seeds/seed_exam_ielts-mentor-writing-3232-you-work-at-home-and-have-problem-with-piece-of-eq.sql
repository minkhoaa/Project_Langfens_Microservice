Unfortunately, the device has developed a serious issue that is disrupting my work.\\nThe issue with the printer is that it frequently jams while printing multiple pages and often produces faded or streaked prints, despite using a brand-new toner cartridge. I have followed the troubleshooting steps provided in the manual, but the problem persists.\\nAs I work from home as a freelance graphic designer, having a reliable printer is essential for my job. This malfunction has caused significant delays in completing my projects, leading to missed deadlines and dissatisfied clients.\\nConsidering that the printer is still under warranty, I would appreciate it if you could either repair or replace the faulty unit at your earliest convenience. Please let me know how to proceed with the return or repair process.\\nI look forward to your prompt response.\\nYours sincerely,\\nLeo Zhang", "Dear Sir or Madam,\\nThree months ago, I purchased a Dell laptop from your store. Unfortunately, the device has suddenly stopped working and is now totally unusable. I really need this laptop to complete my work as I work from home, and I am hoping that you will repair or replace it soon.\\nIn relation to the specifics of the problem, the laptop screen does not show anything except a black screen with some red dots on it. It worked just fine the day before yesterday but is dysfunctional right now. I have checked the battery and power connection, and also tried to realise the problem from the sound of the laptop. But I could not find any solid reason. For your kind information, my purchase number is 2558745, and I am attaching a copy of my receipt with this letter.\\nI am a freelancer and have a few running projects that I need to finish before the end of this month. If my laptop does not work, I am unable to work. Besides, I have important files, software and in-progress project instructions on this laptop which means I am stuck without them.\\nSince I have a valid warranty, and I need this device to be fixed immediately, I am hoping that you would repair it within the next three days or replace it with a new one and transfer the data.\\nI hope to hear from you soon.\\nYours faithfully,\\nMonica Smith\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 4.37 (31 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nGT Writing Task 1\\nFormal Letter\\nComplaints-letter\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\nSaravanan\\n5 years 8 months\\nDear Sir or Madam,\\nI am currently using a Lenovo Desktop computer that I purchased from your outlet a couple of months ago. The computer was set up in my home by a staff member from your company. The product comes with a 3-year standard warranty but recently, it has started giving me trouble. Since I am working from home at that moment, I would like you to resolve the issues immediately.\\nFor the last two weeks, I have been facing terrible issues with the system. Firstly, the performance of the system has degraded, and there are visible lags when navigating between screens. In addition to that, the keyboard has issues resulting in wrong keystrokes. Furthermore, the UPS system gives just 10 minutes backup rather than the promised 45 minutes!\\nThese cumulative problems are bringing my work to a complete stop. I cannot continue my critical projects from home and is ruining my performance significantly. My managers have started to complain about my excuses about the computer.\\nI would like you to immediately send a skilled service person to my home who could fix those issues and replace the UPS. I also request you to please get the assembled parts verified for quality before selling them to the customers.\\nI am expecting a quick response from you on this critical issue.\\nYours faithfully,\\nSaravanan H\\nReply\\nQuote\\n×\\nReport\\nReport\\nClose"]'::jsonb,
