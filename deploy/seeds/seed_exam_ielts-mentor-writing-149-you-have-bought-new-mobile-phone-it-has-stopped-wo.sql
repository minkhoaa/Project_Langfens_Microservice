  E'You should spend about\n20\nminutes on this task.\nYou have bought a new mobile phone and in a few days of purchase, it has stopped working. You spoke to the company representative a week ago but it has still not been repaired.\nWrite a letter to the company. In your letter,\nintroduce yourself\nexplain the situation\nsay what action you would like the company to take\nWrite at least\n150\nwords.\nYou do\nNOT\nneed to write any addresses.\nBegin your letter as follows:\nDear Sir or Madam,\nModel\nAnswer 1:\nDear Sir or Madam,\nTwo weeks ago I purchased a brand new mobile phone from your shop. I was excited to have purchased it but very disappointed to find that the phone was poorly produced and stopped working within a week of purchase. I have talked to one of your representatives over the phone twice but nothing has been done so far. I am hoping you will replace it immediately.\nIn relation to the specifics of the order, I purchased this mobile phone from your Davidsons Avenue store on September 23rd and it was a cash purchase. The model of the mobile phone is the OnePlus 12R and it comes with a 6.78-inch display, Android 14 (OxygenOS 14) OS, 50 Megapixel camera, 16 GB RAM and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor. The order number is 25009652 and I am attaching a copy of my receipt.\nThe issue with the phone is that I am unable to start it even after the phone is fully charged. It is dead and unusable for me.  I’m sure this is a manufacturing flaw and I am entitled to get a new phone as a replacement according to the warranty policy. Despite my communication with one of your representatives a week ago, nothing has been done and I seriously doubt the after-sale service you provide.\nAs a solution, and because I really like the functionality and features of this phone, I am hoping that you will agree to replace it with a new one immediately. Otherwise, I would like a full refund and I will be contacting the Bureau of Consumer Protection if I do not hear back from you in regards to this within a week.\nThank you for giving the matter your attention and I hope to hear your reply soon.\nYours faithfully,\nDavid Miller',
