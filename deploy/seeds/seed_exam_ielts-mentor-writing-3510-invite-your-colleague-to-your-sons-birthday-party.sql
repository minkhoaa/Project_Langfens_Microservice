  E'["Dear Traverse,\\nHope this letter reaches you in good health and spirit. My life, of course, is going as usual except that my family is planning big to celebrate my son’s 6th birthday next week on the 4th of December, and my whole family would very much wish that you attend and enjoy the party.\\nTo give you a little idea about the schedule of the birthday party, we will start our programme at around 7:00 pm with a very popular children’s song, to be sung by the little school friends of my son, followed by a display of some of the old and funny videos of him from his infancy. Later on, some light snacks will be provided to refresh the guests which will include my family members, close relatives and close friends. At around 9.00 pm, we will start the cake cutting ceremony. Finally, we will sign off with serving dinner to all the guests.\\nAnyway, you must know how much my son really likes you, and what a great fan he has been of you because of your funny cartoon drawings. So, please come to the party because it would mean a lot to my whole family.\\nYours sincerely,\\nJohn Larry\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 5.00 (4 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nGT Writing Task 1\\nSemi-formal Letter\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\nErtugrul\\n4 years\\nDear Mehmet,\\nHow are you and your family? Are you all doing well? I hope so. I''m writing because I want to invite you and your family to my son’s 6th birthday party next week.\\nWe thought that Green Garden Park ( which is a bit far from the city centre, and next to the new orthopaedic hospital) would be a perfect place for the birthday party because it has an amazing enjoyable area for children. We hired a good fun team including clowns, singers and many more enjoyable activities. I know you don’t have a car, but don’t worry! Sedat who is a friend of both of us from work will pick you and your family up and drop you and your family off after the party. We will start next Sunday at 11 am and finish at 5 pm.\\nWe will be very happy to see you and your family among us. I know you have a girl who is 5 years old and she will be very happy to play games with her peers. Also, my wife wants to see and talk to your wife again.\\nHope you can make it! It won’t be the same without you.\\nTake care,\\nErtuğrul\\nReply\\nQuote\\nSabrina Qamar\\n4 years 11 months\\nDear John,\\nHope you and your family are in good health. I am writing this letter to invite you to my son David’s birthday. On January 26th, he will be turning six.\\nI am organizing a small celebration on the evening of 26th January at hotel Meridian’s banquet hall with my family, close relatives, colleagues, and friends. Most importantly, the theme of the party will be superheroes. David profoundly loves superheroes, and it would be great if all children dress up in their costume. It will be fun, and David will become even more inspired and happy. After the cake cutting ceremony, dinner would be served with starters and drinks.\\nWe will be delighted if you join the celebration with your family. In fact, David already has started planning which games he would play with your daughters, Nancy and Riya that day. I am sure you won''t like to miss the fun we would all have together at the party. So see you there.\\nLots of love,\\nTom and David\\n["]'::jsonb,
