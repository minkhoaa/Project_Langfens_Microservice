  E'["Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI am writing to inform you that I have recently been offered the Landscape Designer position in your company and I am very grateful for the opportunity. But I regret to say that I cannot accept the offer right now.\\nI have known your company for decades and I have heard about the great projects that your company has recently completed. I appreciate your time in checking my portfolio online and I was flattered when I received your invitation. Honestly, it took me one week to weigh in my option.\\nAt the end of the day, I decided to decline the offer because I am happy with my achievements and role in my current company. Besides, I also have a few large ongoing projects that I want to finish first to enhance my portfolio before I decide to explore other job opportunities.\\nI hope that in the future I will have a chance to work and be a part of the success of your company. Thank you once again.\\nYours faithfully,\\nBenchong Dee\\n(", "Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI am writing this letter to convey my gratitude for considering me for the position of Assistant Manager at your company. Unfortunately, I have decided to continue my work with my present employer and hence cannot accept your offer.\\nDuring my interview, I was impressed by the interviewers and their friendly yet professional attitude. Not to mention, your company offers a great working environment and prioritises employee growth. I have a friend who works in your company who highly speaks of your management and office environment. However, the remuneration package that was suggested in the final offer letter is way less than my current salary. My employer offers several other benefits besides the salary and I see excellentcareer growth here.\\nI am thankful to you for the opportunity you have offered me. However, considering my job satisfaction with the current employer and the reward package, I find no other way but to decline your offer. I, however, really appreciate your effort and support.\\nYours Faithfully,\\nJayesh Bhuva", "Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI have been offered a job at your company as a Business Executive and I would like to profoundly thank you for such an opportunity. It is, however, a matter of regret that I must decline your generous offer and apologise for any inconvenience caused due to this.\\nI appreciate immensely the interview organised by your company and the extensive effort of all the staff involved. Their attitude was impressive and highly commendable. As such I must pass my sincerest apologies for any difficulties related to the extra work that must have been involved, and the time wasted on your behalf. Although the offer was substantial, it was not enough to encourage me to sever the bonds with my current employer.\\nDuring my time at my present company, my superiors supported me tremendously and fostered my career. In short, they made me the employee I am today. I love my work here and would not leave them only for a slight salary increase.\\nI would like to keep the lines of communication open between us and look forward to further correspondence.\\nYours faithfully,\\nJuan Carter", "Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI would like to thank you for considering me as a suitable candidate for the position of Assistant Manager in your organisation and in fact, I was eagerly waiting for your call. I, however, cannot accept the offer due to some specific reasons.\\nI sincerely apologise that I would not be able to join your organisation. There are a couple of reasons why I am declining this offer: one of them is the job location and the other is the proposed remuneration. I have to drop off my children at their schools daily and that is why commuting a long distance to reach my office is inconvenient for me. I find my current job more exciting and rewarding.\\nIn my current job, I have flexible timing which allows me to keep a balance between my personal and professional life. Also, I am due for a promotion this year and I am expecting a managerial role to come my way soon. The roles and responsibilities of this new position would be very challenging and a known team with whom I have been working for a long would be an advantage.\\nI would like to thank you again for the job offer but I would like to stay with my current organisation and I am humbly declining your offer. Wishing your superb team members all the best.\\nYours sincerely,\\nSam Johnson\\n("]'::jsonb,
