  E'["Dear Norton,\\nI''m so delighted to receive your letter and writing back to say that I''m fascinated to have you in my country in a few days. I can''t wait to receive you at the airport!\\nI guess this is your first-time visit to Italy, and I''m sure you''ll enjoy your stay and take back some excellent memories. Once you finish your official tasks in Rome, you can spend a day or two there to enjoy the capital city, especially the Colosseum, Castel Sant''Angelo, St. Peter''s Basilica, Trevi Fountain and the Pantheon. You can stay at the Hotel Palladium Palace if your accommodation is not already arranged by your office.\\nThen fly directly to Lucca, the city I''m residing in. Give me a call before you reach the airport, and I''ll be there. I would like you to stay at my place as long as you wish. If you insist on staying at a hotel, you can try Villa Corte Degli Dei or Hotel Napoleon. We will enjoy local food, watch a movie and go boating. We can enjoy scenic beauty every evening.\\nI''d recommend you to bring some warm clothes as the winter is setting in. Do not forget to bring your camera to capture the beauty of the rivers and traditional street views. Also, bring any medicines you take.\\nLooking forward to having you in my city soon.\\nWarm wishes,\\nMarco", "Dear Camellia,\\nI hope you''re doing excellent. I was thrilled to receive your letter yesterday informing me about your upcoming visit to Canada. It''s always a joy to welcome friends and spend some quality time together. I can''t wait to have you here with us.\\nDuring your stay in Canada, there are countless activities and attractions you can explore. Depending on your interests, we might enjoy visiting iconic landmarks such as the CN Tower in Toronto, exploring the historic streets of Old Quebec City, or immersing in the natural splendor of Banff National Park in Alberta. Additionally, you can take the chance to experience Canadian culture by attending local festivals, trying traditional cuisine, and interacting with friendly locals.\\nAs for accommodation, it will be a pleasure if you stay with me. However, if you prefer an alternative, I would recommend considering options such as vacation rentals through platforms like Airbnb. Alternatively, if you prefer a more immersive experience, you could look into staying with a host family through programs like Homestay Canada.\\nWhen packing for your trip to Canada, be sure to bring clothing suitable for the weather, as it can vary greatly depending on the season and region. Layers are key, especially if you plan to visit during the colder months. Additionally, don''t forget essentials such as a sturdy pair of walking shoes, a reusable water bottle, and any necessary travel documents.\\nI am eagerly anticipating your visit and can''t wait to show you around our beautiful country. Please let me know if there''s anything specific you''d like to see or do during your time here.\\nSafe travels, and see you soon!\\nWarm regards,\\nEmma", "Dear Alfred,\\nI am so excited to hear that you''re planning a trip to Vietnam! There''s so much to see and do here, and I know you''ll have a fantastic time. Let''s make it a memorable tour and enjoy some time together.\\nVietnam offers something for everyone. If you''re into bustling cities, Ho Chi Minh City is a must-see. Explore the Ben Thanh Market for souvenirs and local treats, or visit the Notre Dame Cathedral and Central Post Office for a touch of French influence. For a more laid-back experience, Hoi An Ancient Town is breathtaking. Wander the colourful streets lined with tailor shops and art galleries, or take a boat tour on the Thu Bon River at sunset. Nature lovers won''t be disappointed either. Ha Long Bay is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and a cruise through its emerald waters amidst towering limestone karsts is an unforgettable experience.\\nWhen it comes to accommodation, Vietnam has a variety of options to suit different budgets. Hostels are a great way to meet fellow travellers, while boutique hotels offer a luxurious stay. However, I would be more than happy to accommodate you at my home during your whole stay if you prefer. I have already talked to my parents, and they are excited to meet you.\\nSince Vietnam has a tropical climate, pack light, breathable clothing like cotton t-shirts, shorts, and sundresses. Comfortable shoes are essential for exploring, and a light rain jacket is recommended, especially during May to October. Don''t forget a hat and sunscreen – the sun can be quite strong!\\nI can''t wait to show you around my beautiful country! See you soon.\\nWarm wishes,\\nHoa", "Dear Jonathan,\\nHope you''re doing great. I''m very exhilarated to know that you''ll come to my city with your family next month. It''s an excellent decision to visit Singapore during your children''s school vacation, and I''m sure you all will enjoy your time.\\nAfter you reach my city, we can book tickets for Night Safari, Adventure Cove Park and Universal Studio. Those are quite popular among tourists, and I''ve specifically selected them considering your children.\\nI would love to have you at my house. I have a large house and you will enjoy your privacy. However, if you would like to stay separate, my suggestion is Bukit Timah Road. So, book the Banana Leaf Hotel or Pandora Hotel if you must stay at a Hotel. But I insist that you stay at my place.\\nAs I know, your ''princess daughter'' is only three years old. You should pack her food and suitable dresses for the summer. It is advisable to bring the necessary medicines with you. Without a prescription, you won''t be able to purchase any medicine here.\\nSee you at Changi Airport on the 28th of July.\\nWith Best Regards\\nEirene\\n["]'::jsonb,
