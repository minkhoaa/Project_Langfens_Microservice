  E'["Dear Mr Abraham,\\nI am Gordon Matthew and I had a phone conversation with you yesterday morning regarding the tour we are going to embark on at Tenby. Now I am writing to seek some information about tour facilities you offer.\\nWe expect to reach Tenby On 14th October 2019 and will stay there for three days and two nights. We have 26 people in our group – 16 men and 8 women. In addition, two children will accompany the team and they are our dean’s daughters who are between 8-10 years old. Among the adults, 14 male and 6 female students will share rooms while two professors will have family suits as their wives and children’s are accompanying them. Hence, we will require 10 double-bedrooms with a great view and 2 family suits in the vicinity in total. We hope to keep our expenses moderate and have a peaceful experience while we stay there.\\nPlease send me details about the rooms you have available during the time, type of facilities and food you serve with estimated costs for all those. Also inform me about the recreational facilities, worth-visiting places and things-to-do in this area. Should we bring any special equipment or dress for our tour? Finally, please do inform me how can I book the reservation once I am convinced about your arrangement.\\nI look forward to receiving the information as soon as possible from you. Thank you in advance for your kind cooperation.\\nYours sincerely,\\nGordon Matthew", "Dear Mr Abraham,\\nI am Henry Brown, a teacher from the Brighton Scholar''s School, United Kingdom, and writing to inquire about the accommodation facilities you offer as we are planning a trip to Tenby soon.\\nAccording to our previous email correspondence, I would like to inform you that we are a team of 18 members, including three teachers, and would be staying in Tenby between 12th and 18th June 2019. I would request you to inform me about the availability of your rooms and the type of service you offer. Those rooms should be on the same floor and with heating facilities. Our budget is moderate and would like to know the facilities you offer, like breakfast, tour guide and vehicles within the price.\\nSince this is an educational expedition, we will mostly stay out and this is why the security of our belongings is a concern for us. I hope your lodge can ensure that. Please let me know about the reservation and payment process so that we can book our rooms ell in advance. Any other tips for us? Please feel free to mention.\\nI look forward to hearing from you soon.
