  E'["Dear Sir or Madam,\\nRecently, I have taken a short cookery course at your renowned institute, and I am writing this letter to express how happy I am about the course, which I attended about a month ago, in an effort to enhance my culinary arts skills.\\nI must admit that even though the course was taught intensively for a good period of four weeks, I felt like the time had passed rather quickly since I enjoyed the course so much. By the way, the best thing about the course was that it comprehensively taught me about the art of making some Italian and oriental desserts quickly and easily. Besides, I enjoyed learning about the tricks of chopping meats so nicely.\\nAfter finishing the cookery course, I used some of my cooking skills to prepare some delicious desserts for the birthday party of one of my close friends in addition to preparing some of my favourite dishes for my family. Before ending here, I would also like to request you to introduce a short course at your institute on preparing desserts by using different kinds of tropical fruits and vegetables.\\nThank you once again for conducting such a useful course.\\nYours faithfully,\\nAndre Dmitry", "Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI recently completed the Traditional Chinese Cuisine course at your cookery school, and I would like to express my appreciation for the experience. I am also excited to be contacted to offer my feedback.\\nThe hands-on approach, combined with the expert guidance of the instructors, made learning both enjoyable and effective. I particularly loved how the course focused on authentic techniques, such as mastering the perfect dumpling folds and achieving the right balance of flavours in Sichuan dishes.\\nSince completing the course, I have been cooking much more frequently. I have recreated several dishes, including Kung Pao Chicken and Cantonese-style steamed fish, for my family and friends. They have been very impressed with the flavours, and I feel more confident in my cooking skills.\\nI would love to see your school offer a course on Chinese Street Food Specialties. Many iconic dishes, such as Jianbing (savoury crepes) and Roujiamo (Chinese burgers), are popular worldwide, and a course dedicated to them would be a great addition.\\nThank you once again for an enriching experience. I look forward to joining another course soon.\\nYours faithfully,\\nLi Wei\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 4.23 (30 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nGT Writing Task 1\\nFormal Letter\\nLetter Writing Sample\\ngive feedback\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\nD\\n1 year 3 months\\nDear Sir or Madam,\\nI recently had the pleasure of attending the Asian Cooking crash course, and I want to express my heartfelt thanks for the wonderful experience that I have had.\\nWhat I loved most about the course was the highly interactive, hands-on approach that allowed me to learn new skills under the direct supervision of skilled professionals. The professionals were not only knowledgeable but also approachable, providing valuable insights and demonstrating the different techniques through step-by-step methods, which made even the most intricate dishes seem accessible and achievable. Additionally, the class size was perfect, allowing for more personalised guidance and I truly appreciated the attention to detail in the teaching style.\\nSince I have taken the course, I have had the opportunity to recreate several of the recipes we learnt, much to the appreciation of my family and friends. This course has helped me hone my existing skills and given me the confidence to experiment with new flavours and techniques. I have put my skills to good use and have even hosted dinner parties, presenting dishes I learnt, all of which were met with high praise.\\nOne suggestion I would like to offer to the school is to introduce additional courses on other international cuisines such as Mediterranean and South American Cooking so that students can explore different culinary traditions and deepen their cultural understanding through food.\\nThank you once again for the wonderful experience.\\nYours Sincerely,\\n[Full Name]\\nReply\\nQuote\\nAnastasiia Efimova\\n1 year 9 months\\nDear Sir or Madam,\\nI am writing to provide feedback on the recent short cookery course that I attended at your school.\\nI thoroughly enjoyed the course and found it to be very informative and enjoyable. The instructor was knowledgeable and enthusiastic, and the classes were well-paced and engaging. I particularly enjoyed the hands-on cooking sessions, which gave me the opportunity to practice the techniques that I had learned.\\nSince completing the course, I have been cooking more frequently at home. I have tried out several of the recipes that I learned in class, and I have also experimented with some of my own creations. I am pleased to report that my cooking skills have improved significantly since taking the course.\\nI would like to suggest that the school offers a course on advanced cooking techniques. This course could cover topics such as knife skills, sauce making, and plating. I believe that this course would be of interest to many people, including those who have already taken the short cookery course.\\nThank you again for the excellent course. I look forward to attending more courses at your school in the future.\\nYours faithfully,\\nAnastasiia Efimova\\nReply\\nQuote\\nInder\\n2 years 6 months\\nDear Sir or Madam,\\nI am writing this letter to offer some feedback regarding the culinary programme and to suggest another cookery programme that I think many people, including me, would be interested in.\\nThere are two main reasons why I loved so much taking this course in my curriculum. Firstly, it has taught me many new international meals that I had never even heard of before. Secondly, because of this course, I got the chance to meet new friends from all over the world with different mindsets regarding cooking skills. All in all, this course has successfully facilitated me in broadening my horizons.\\nAfter getting enrolled in this course, my interest in cooking has grown and I try to cook everyday new cuisine by myself instead of ordering junk food from outside. However, before this, I used to rely on tiffin service.\\nI would like to suggest commencing a new cookery course, which will only focus on different types of drinks such as cocktails, mocktails and many more. Thus, students will get the chance to learn to make drinks along with palatable dishes.\\nThank you for your consideration.\\nYours faithfully,\\nGlan Lee\\nReply\\nQuote\\nLeo\\n4 years 5 months\\nDear Sir or Madam,\\nMy name is Pablo, and I was a student in the short-term cookery course at your institute. I am writing to let you know that I am excited to be asked to give my feedback about the course, and I have only positive feedback about the course offered and how it was conducted. It was an accomplishment from my side with the help of the institute and the chef lecturers.\\nBefore enrolling on this course, I could not even fry an egg, but thanks to the short but intense practical classes offered, I am now confident that I would get a job in a French restaurant like La Vie En Rose. You would be glad to know that, I am a junior cook at a local restaurant and I overlook the appetizer station for lunch and dinner. This is all due to the hands-on classes that you offered.\\nLearning to cook is mostly repetition and that is what was implemented during the course. One of the reasons why I enjoyed doing the classes. We were even given the chance to work with quality ingredients and commercial grade equipment. All those helped me a lot.\\nI am looking forward to enrolling in another short course but I could not seem to find any that is related to pastry making. I believe this is a good subject to be taught. Pastries are in trend right now judging from the abundance of pastry shops around. Please do take this idea into consideration.\\nI look forward to hearing about this new course being offered.\\nThank you.\\nYours faithfully,\\nPablo Mojo\\nReply\\nQuote\\nNelson\\n4 years 6 months\\nDear Sir or Madam,\\nI am writing this letter to give my feedback on the cooking course that I took a few months ago in your institution. I do appreciate your consideration for my feedback and I am looking forward to doing another course from your training institution soon.\\nDuring my three months course in your institution, I have learned many things related to cooking and I do appreciate the value you have added to my culinary arts skills. Though it was very intensive, I really liked the manner in which the instructors conveyed their lessons on African cuisines so easily.\\nMoreover, I have used some of the skills to prepare my favourite delicacy and dishes for my family and friends. For this reason, I will really appreciate it if you include some French dishes in your program.\\nWhile waiting to hear from you, I appreciate all that you did and are still doing.\\nYours faithfully,\\nNelson Obina\\nReply\\nQuote\\nUpi\\n4 years 6 months\\nYou recently did a short cookery course.

I completed your Traditional Cuisine Course about 3 months ago, and I learned so many things from it.\\nAttending your cookery course was an astonishing experience for me as I have always wanted to learn some amazing traditional dishes so that I could surprise my family and friends by serving them tasty and stunning dishes. After completing the course, it was a great experience to try different recipes without any guidance. It was wonderful to experiment with my dishes with full confidence which I have learned from this course.\\nI have prepared many dishes since I did complete my course 3 months ago as there were many events and celebrations in which I presented my dishes to our guests. They loved my cooking very much, thanks to the course and the teachers who taught us there.\\nIt was a great journey to gain so much knowledge and confidence. I also made some new friends during the course who are also passionate about cooking and experimenting with dishes.\\nI would like to say that it would be great if we can have a bakery and dessert course at your institute.

The instructor - Jocelyn, taught the class with great passion whilst making the learning process fun, which made the whole experience very enjoyable. Furthermore, with this course, I learned some new delicious recipes that I have never tried before, which was wonderful.\\nInspired by the course and the instructor, I made my favourite dish I learnt from the classes for a small party I hosted, in addition to cooking a few other recipes for my family every weekend since the end of the class. Everyone was very amazed at how savoury and palatable the food was.\\nIt would be great if the institute provided baking classes, specifically done with chocolate and fruits as everyone loves dessert. I believe more people will enrol in this course if you include it.\\nI am thankful to you for providing me with some great culinary skills.\\nYours faithfully,\\nCharmi Padhiyar\\nReply\\nQuote\\nRatnesh Chouhan\\n5 years 3 months\\nYou recently did a short cookery course.

I would also like to suggest a new course that I believe would be quite helpful for people who are interested in Indian Cuisine.\\nI was an amateur in the field of cooking before joining the course, but then magic happened. As soon as I enrolled in the program, everything looked extremely easy and comfortable. The credit goes to the excellent guidance of the instructors. I thoroughly enjoyed learning and cooking all the recipes in the course which included Chapati, Butter Chicken, Masala Chai, Lentils, Legumes, Salads etc. However, what I enjoyed the most was preparing traditional desserts. Since I have a sweet tooth and my family and friends are huge fans of various sweet preparations, this section of the course has helped me immensely.\\nAfter completing the course, I frequently indulged in preparing a variety of sugary items like pudding, cakes, pastries and a lot of Indian sweets on different occasions. As a result, I have received lots of appreciations and encouragement from my family and close friends.\\nAs a result, I am considering to enrol in a comprehensive cooking course that will help further enhance my culinary skills, especially to make traditional Indian desserts. If I may recommend, would it be possible for you to commence another cookery course focusing on desserts preparation? I and a few others would be glad to attend the same.\\nI am looking forward to your positive response.\\nYours faithfully,\\nRatnesh Chouhan\\nReply\\nQuote\\nVishwjeet Singh\\n5 years 6 months\\nIn the second line of the first paragraph, after how much, happy is OK or it has to be happier?\\nReply\\nQuote\\nSita\\n5 years 7 months\\nDear Sir or Madam,\\nI am writing this letter in response to your mail that I received yesterday regarding feedback for the Baking and Decorating, a 4 days course that we did from 27th March 2020 at your training institution.\\nI can say that I have become a great fan of baking in just a short span of time. I was so excited to attend the classes given by Mrs Parker Tellans, a specialist in baking, which was the highlight of the course. Not only the lectures by the trainers but also the decorating section had taken the class to a next level. Finally, hands-on on the latest types of equipment in baking is something that I enjoyed a lot.\\nAfter the course, I have done baking for 2 small birthday parties, one for my cousin and one for my friend. The menu included 3 tier cakes, pastries, cupcakes, muffins, cookies taught from your school which got a whole-hearted appreciation from my friends and family.\\nI would like to suggest some other courses to be conducted at your training institute during the next summer, including dessert items course, for instance, pie, tarts, cheesecakes, some dairy-free ice creams and some sugar-free treats.\\nOnce again, thanks for such a great course,\\nYours faithfully,\\nSita Roy\\nReply\\nQuote\\n×\\nReport\\nReport\\nClose"]'::jsonb,
