  E'You Had Been Charged For Items You Did Not Purchase',
  E'You should spend about\n20\nminutes on this task.\nYou recently went shopping at the local supermarket. When you got home and noticed your bill, you found that you had been charged for items you did not purchase.\nWrite a letter to the supermarket manager explaining what has happened. Tell the manager how you feel about the error and tell the manager what you would like him/her to do about it.\nWrite at least\n150\nwords.\nYou do\nNOT\nneed to write any addresses.\nBegin your letter as follows:\nDear Sir or Madam,\nSample Answer 1:\nDear Sir or Madam,\nI am a regular customer of your shop and went there earlier today to do some shopping. I am quite disappointed to notice that I was billed for items that I did not purchase at all. Unfortunately, I noticed it only when I returned home. I am hoping that you would rectify the issue.\nI visited your shop at around 9.30 am on Sunday, July 2025 and purchased a number of items. I paid my bill to a young lady who was managing the cash queue 4. I gave her my VISA credit card and was charged 142 dollars and 25 cents for all of my items. The counter was unusually busy and I did not have enough time to crosscheck the amount of the goods I purchased. When I got back home and studied the bill, I noticed some errors. I was charged for each item I bought and in addition, for a pair of socks, 100-gram cheese, a bottle of shampoo and one-kilo apple. I checked again whether they actually packed those items for me and there were nowhere to be found! As I observed, I was 24.75 dollars overcharged for the items I have not purchased.\nI am attaching the receipt for your consideration and would like you to refund my amount next time I visit your mall. A mistake like this is not acceptable from a shop like yours. Please take the necessary steps to rectify this error and make sure it does not happen again.\nI look forward to getting a reply from you promptly.\nThanking you,\nGazelle Nilla\nSample Answer 2:\nDear Sir or Madam,\nI am Emma Ariana, a frequent shopper of your mega mall. Yesterday I went to your mall located in Rainbow Complex and purchased a few items. However, after I returned home and noticed my bill, I was bewildered as I was billed for items that I have not purchased! I hope you would rectify the error made by one of your employees.\nIn relation to the specifics of the purchase, I bought a pair of sandals, a towel, a bottle of shampoo, a coffee mug, a box of chocolate, cat food, shower gel and some packeted foods, for which I have been billed and in addition 115 dollars for items I have not picked at all! My invoice number is MR8-C1254, dated 15th May 2025, and the invoice amount is $247. It shows that I have purchased a large flower vessel, a doormat and a water purifier! This must be a mistake!\nI was in a hurry and did not cross-check the items against the bill while checking out from the queue. But I am sure the salesgirl, whose name is Marinda, had made some sort of mistake while printing my invoice.\nI would like you to refund the extra amount next time I visit your shop and make sure this unwanted situation does not repeat.\nYours faithfully,\nEmma Ariana',

After I got back home and noticed the bill, I was surprised to find that I had been overcharged. I am hoping that you would take steps not to repeat such mistakes and return me the overcharged amount.\\nIn relation to the specifics of the bill, I went to your Daily Needs shop on 28th March 2025 at around 5.30 pm and purchased 6 items in total. I paid $230.50 for the items using my Master Card issued by City Bank. The invoice number is 28-462014 and I am attaching a copy of my receipt.\\nThe issue with the bill is that my actual invoice should have been 49.45 dollars less than the amount paid. The invoice indicates that I bought 9 items, which is a mistake. I have been charged for a pair of socks, a bottle of virgin olive oil and an air freshener which I never did purchase.\\nAs a solution, and because I am a loyal customer of your shop, I am hoping that you will agree to refund me the extra amount or adjust it with my next bill.\\nThank you for giving the matter your attention and I hope to hear your reply soon.\\nYours faithfully,\\nTommy Lee\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 4.58 (12 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nFormal Letter\\nComplaints-letter\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\n×\\nReport\\nReport\\nClose"]'::jsonb,
