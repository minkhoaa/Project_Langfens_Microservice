  E'["Dear Simmons,\\nHope you''re doing great. I''m still relishing the pleasant memories we had together during our last trip - it was wonderful. I''m writing to let you know that we''ve moved into a house in Bath, a town set in the rolling countryside of southwest England. I hope you would visit us soon.\\nAs you know, my previous apartment was far away from my office and it was inconvenient both for me and Anna to commute a long distance daily. However, we could not shift our house considering Julie''s school location. This summer I transferred her to Kingswood School in Bath and moved here soon after. Now the daily commute is no longer a cause of concern for us.\\nWe moved into this house at the beginning of February and we really like it. A small garden at the front makes it even more beautiful. We now have enough space to park 3 cars! It has five rooms, a lawn and two large balconies. The best part is that the area is quiet and surrounded by astonishing natural beauty. After living in a flat in a busy area for nearly 8 years, a spacious house seems like a dream come true.\\nI hope you would visit us soon as I''m really looking forward to having you and Linda with us for a few days. It will be fun.\\nHope to meet you soon.\\nWarm wishes,\\nMitchell", "Dear Henry,\\nI know it would come to you as a surprise, but I''ve finally moved to a new house after living in my previous house for such a long time. Of course, it was not an easy decision for me, given how much I loved that house because of its proximity to a beautiful lake and animal sanctuary. But I needed to move out of it because its owner wanted to renovate it and then sell it to some corporate businesspeople at a very handsome profit.\\nOf course, the new house, which I moved in, is a great place since it is a lot more spacious than my previous house. Besides, the new house is built with some solid wood, which I really like, because it would help the house to keep at a comfortable temperature throughout the year.  So, it would mean that I''d have to spend a lot less money on the electricity bill to maintain a comfortable temperature at my house unlike the old one. Finally, it''s located in a beautiful neighbourhood.\\nSo, come and visit me sometime, possibly next weekend. I believe you would also like my new house.\\nWarm wishes,\\nPatrick\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 3.57 (21 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nGT Writing Task 1\\nInformal Letter\\nletter to a friend\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\nSila\\n6 years 4 months\\nDear Alice,\\nHope you are doing great. I miss you so much and it''s been long since you have written to me. I have recently moved to a new house primarily because my previous house was very old and far away from my workplace. I have been planning to move to a large and new house near my office and I really like this new house I have rented.\\nMy new home is ten minutes walking distance from my office and much larger than the previous one. It has a big garden and a green lawn that I love so much. The pink shutters of the house, ornamental pool, beautiful flowers in the garden and great architecture of my house are works of arts to me!\\nThe rooms in the house are quite large and I have almost finished decorating the house and for that, I have bought some new furniture and artworks. You will be surprised at the blue & pink harmony of the house and the beautiful greenery in front of the house. I would like you to visit me and spend some time with me in my new house.\\nI look forward to seeing you in my new home. I am sure you will arrive as soon as possible.\\nTake Care.\\nWarm wishes,\\nSila Korkut\\nReply\\nQuote\\n×\\nReport\\nReport\\nClose"]'::jsonb,
