  E'["Dear Victor,\\nHope this letter finds you in good health and spirit. I sure also would like to thank you for trusting me with such an important matter. So, here is what I''ve to say in response to your queries about the Pharmacy course at Monash University.\\nI understand that you also want to pursue a bachelor degree in Pharmacy from Monash University which I attended. By the way, pharmacy is not an easy subject since it involves very complex techniques and skills of preparing and dispensing medicines or drugs, and thus saving human life also. Students attending pharmacy degrees will learn how different types of drugs affect the human body and mind and how they interact when mixed together.\\nOf course, the good thing is that the university, you''re choosing, has some of the best pharmacy syllabuses, faculty members and laboratory facilities to teach you just what you need to succeed.\\nSo, just visit the university website at www.monash.edu to learn more about how to apply online, or just call the admission officer to ask him or her to send you the admission form and other necessary papers in the mail, if you want to proceed further.\\nTake care. See you soon.\\nWarm wishes,\\nMitchel", "Dear Ruhan,\\nI hope you’re doing great! I am excited to learn that you’re considering applying for the same course that I studied at university.

The course covered a wide range of topics, including Media Theory and Analysis, Journalism and News Reporting, Media Law and Ethics, Global Media and Communication and so on. The professors were knowledgeable and supportive, and the university had excellent facilities, including a well-stocked library and modern labs.\\nI highly recommend Goldsmiths, University of London because of its strong academic reputation, great campus environment, and excellent career support services. The networking opportunities and industry connections also helped many of my classmates secure jobs right after graduation.\\nTo apply, I suggest you start by checking the university’s official website for entry requirements and deadlines. Be sure to prepare a strong personal statement explaining why you’re passionate about this field, and gather any required documents, such as transcripts and recommendation letters.\\nIf you have any questions or need help with your application, just let me know.

I received your letter in which you asked for my advice as you are thinking to apply for the same course that I did in the past. First of all, I''m delighted that you considered me for such an important matter.\\nBefore my Master’s degree, I had studied this 16-week graphics designing course at Melbourne State University. This course often takes place during the summer holidays. Students, who enrol in this course, go through extensive designing and simulation workshops from Monday to Friday. The course follows a specific flow chart covering topics one by one starting from the very basics of colour recognition, differentiation , drawing, transferring the design into the software, and in the end finalizing it.\\nMelbourne State University is one of the most reliable institutions because it holds a decent reputation in this specific course. It also offers many types of waver in fees. Along with other facilities, this university has skilled trainers and teachers.\\nThe enrollment process is very simple, you just have to fill out forms that are easily available online on the university’s website, or you can find them at the library. After completing the application form, submit it to the admission office. The fee will be paid online through a debit or credit card. Your admission process will be completed after the verification of the fee submission.\\nSo, that’s all there is to advise. I hope this will benefit you. Don’t mind reaching out in case you need more help from me.\\nTake care. See you soon.\\nBest wishes,\\nWadood\\nReply\\nQuote\\nGuru\\n4 years 10 months\\nDear Visu,\\nI hope you are doing good. Thank you for considering and trusting me with such an important decision. So, here is what I have to say in response to your queries about a Bachelor''s degree in a Computer Science & Engineering course at the University of Mumbai.\\nI understand that you want to pursue a career in Computer Science and Engineering from the University of Mumbai which I attended. First of all, \\"Computer Science & Engineering\\" is not for someone who lacks good command in Mathematics, Physics and technologies. It took quite a long time initially for me to understand the terminology in the subject. However, the university has world-class infrastructure and facilities that anyone can access easily and learn the subject they are interested in. Especially, the computer lab and library would be of great help to the students here. You will also have online forums where you can ask for extra materials and help from your seniors and lecturers.\\nSo, just visit the website of the university and the success stories of the students who had already placed in different multinational companies and IT companies. Moreover, if you want to proceed further, you may need to apply online before the 15th of this month.\\nTake care and see you soon.\\nWarm wishes,\\nGtata\\nReply\\nQuote\\n×\\nReport\\nReport\\nClose"]'::jsonb,
