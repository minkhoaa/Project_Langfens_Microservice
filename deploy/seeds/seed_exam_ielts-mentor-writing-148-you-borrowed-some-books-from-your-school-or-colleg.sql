  E'["Dear Mr Alfred,\\nI am a 3rd year nursing major student and a regular borrower of books from our college library. I have borrowed two reference books from the library a week ago but I am afraid I cannot return them in time. I am writing to request an extension to the return date to avoid any fine.\\nI have borrowed two books titled ''Psychiatric Nursing 5th Edition'' by Sheila Videbeck and ''Psychology for Nurses'' by Harold Mcgarry on 15th September from the college library. My library card number is 442805 and these two books were issued to this card. My due date to return these books is tomorrow. However, it is very unfortunate that my grandmother has been admitted to a hospital in my hometown due to her heart failure and I will travel to Manila, the capital of the Philippines to visit her. I guess at the time you are reading this letter, I am on my way to Manila. I will probably stay there a couple of days and thus be unable to return the books before the deadline.\\nConsidering my situation, I am hoping you would permit me to keep the books for four more days. Kindly, extend the return date to 27th September so that I can avoid any fine or penalty for a late submission.\\nI am expecting your kind consideration regarding this matter.\\nYours sincerely,\\nLyn Olivar\\n[", "Dear Ms Susan,\\nI am writing this letter to request an extension to the deadline for returning two books which I borrowed from the college library on 18th April. I am hoping you would allow an extension and save me from paying a late fee.\\nAfter borrowing the books out on 18th April, I utilised them to write an assignment which I have almost completed. Unfortunately, I got an urgent phone call from my sister regarding my maternal uncle''s illness. He has been hospitalised last night and I will catch a flight to Italy in a few hours to see him.\\nI think I will have to stay there for at least three to four days. I will, however, get back at the beginning of next week and would be able to return the books promptly.\\nUnder the circumstances, I trust you would kindly waive any fines that might accumulate from the extension of the deadline to return the books.\\nYours sincerely,\\nMary Miere", "Dear Miss Penny,\\nOn 15th February I borrowed three books from the school library and I am due to return the books on 22nd February. Unfortunately, I am travelling to New Jersey tomorrow morning to see my uncle who has been taken to a local hospital. Thus I would be unable to return the borrowed books in due time. I am hoping you would consider the late return of the book and do not impose any overdue fine on me.\\nI borrowed these books using my library card - PA452147 on 22nd February and I am supposed to return those by 27th February. But, I regret to inform you that I would not be able to return them in time. My uncle, who is very close to me, fall ill last evening and was admitted to a hospital. I will travel to visit him earlier tomorrow. Regrettably, the library will remain closed tomorrow and my deadline to return the books is the day after tomorrow.\\nConsidering the current situation, I cannot return the borrowed book before 5th March as I might stay in New Jersey for a couple of days. Therefore, I request you to extend the date of return by another week. I am hoping you would not impose any late fine on me. However, if this is not possible, I am willing to pay any fine for the late submission of borrowed books.\\nI am hoping to hear from you soon.\\nYours sincerely,\\nRamanuj  Arjun\\n[", "Dear Mr Smith,\\nI have been issued three books from the college library on 20th February 2025 and I am supposed to return them exactly seven days later.
