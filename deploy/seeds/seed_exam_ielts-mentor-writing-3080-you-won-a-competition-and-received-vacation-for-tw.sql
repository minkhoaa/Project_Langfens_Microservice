Recently, I have won a spelling bee competition, which was organized by the Spelling Club of the university in my town, and I was awarded a “vacation for two” as a prize.\\nInitially, I was not sure who to go with on this vacation, but then I remembered how you always wanted to see Turkey and its beautiful beaches when we were watching travel shows on the television a long time ago.\\nBy the way, as I have already mentioned, this is a vacation package for two people to visit Turkey and spend a couple of nights at a 5-star hotel in Istanbul. The vacation package also includes a free river cruise on the Bosphorus Strait. Anyway, I would very much like you to go with me on this holiday because you have always cheered for me and encouraged me to do good in the spelling bee competition even when I kept losing. So, I do owe you a little in this success of mine.\\nWarm wishes,\\nStephen Rogers\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 4.83 (9 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nGT Writing Task 1\\nInformal Letter\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\n×\\nReport\\nReport\\nClose"]'::jsonb,
