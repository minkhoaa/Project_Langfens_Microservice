I have been eagerly waiting to meet you in a few days and spend some pleasant time in England. However, my younger sister gave birth to a baby boy two days ago and would be staying at our home for around 3 weeks. I am afraid I will have to reschedule my visit to England in early June instead of early May.\nI have almost finished my preparation to travel to England and applied for the visa. If things go as expected, I will get the visa in a week. Despite my anticipation to meet you on 3rd May, my current situation forces me to delay the tour for a month. My sister has had her first baby and she is staying with us. We are so happy to have a new angel in our family and my presence is quite important for the baby and the mother. I am the only male member of the family and cannot desert my family while I travel to England.\nI am so sorry that I cannot visit you as initially planned and it must be hard for you to reschedule everything. I wish I have had an alternative!\nWishing to meet you on 4th June if everything goes smoothly.\nTake care and have an excellent time ahead.\nWarm wishes,\nJonathon',

  E'["Dear Oliver,\\nHope you and your family are doing great. I know that you wouldn’t like to hear what I am just about to say, but it looks like I won’t be able to visit you this coming summer, during mid-July, as was the plan, because I will have to stay in my country for an important event.\\nIn fact, one of my close cousins has suddenly announced that he is going to get married this coming summer in mid-July, just when I made a plan to visit you in England. By the way, it is a love marriage, and the parents of my cousins didn’t really agree with this kind of love marriage until suddenly they changed their minds about a week ago. Quite understandably, my cousin didn’t want to waste this opportunity, and so he wanted to get married as soon as possible.\\nSo, again, I am really sorry that I won’t be able to visit you this summer and do all those fun things which we planned. But, if you are still up for the fun, I could still visit you the next month in August.\\nWarm wishes,\\nFarhad\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 4.93 (7 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nGT Writing Task 1\\nInformal Letter\\nPersonal Letter\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\nAd\\n10 years 3 months\\nNot good.\\nReply\\nQuote\\n×\\nReport\\nReport\\nClose"]'::jsonb,
