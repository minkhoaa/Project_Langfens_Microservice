  E'["Dear Mr Giovanni,\\nI hope this letter finds you in good health and spirit. I am writing to discuss the possibility of extending my rental agreement for the apartment I have been staying in for the past five months. Initially, I had planned to rent the apartment for only six months, but I would now like to extend my stay for an additional year, if possible.\\nThe reason for this change is that my Computer Science studies here in Turin have been extended due to additional coursework and a research opportunity that I have recently been offered. Since I have already settled into the apartment and find it very comfortable, I would prefer to continue living here rather than searching for a new place.\\nAdditionally, I wanted to bring to your attention a small issue with the heating system. As the colder months are approaching, I have noticed that it takes a long time to warm up the rooms properly. If you could arrange for a technician to check it, I would really appreciate it.\\nPlease let me know if an extension would be possible and under what terms. I look forward to your response.\\nYours sincerely,\\nHalbert Stone\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 5.00 (5 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nGT Writing Task 1\\nSemi-formal Letter\\nLetter to landlord\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\nKhalid Alqahtani\\n4 months 21 days\\nDear Mr Giovanni,\\nI hope this letter finds you well. I am writing this letter to inquire about the possibility of extending the apartment term from one year to two years. The initial agreement was for six months, which is due to expire soon, and now I would like to extend it to two years.\\nThe reason for this change is that I got a job close to this apartment, and I also find it comfortable in terms of cleanliness, quietness, and the availability of all services. Therefore, I would like to stay here for another one and a half years.\\nI would also like to bring to your attention that there are a couple of problems in the apartment. The first problem is that the air conditioner does not work properly, and the room temperature is high during the summer. Since the summer is approaching soon, please have someone fix the issue. Another problem is the sound problem with the TV. I think a mechanic needs to see it and change the speaker in order to fix it. Thank you in advance.\\nYours sincerely,\\nKhalid Alqahtani\\nReply\\nQuote\\n×\\nReport\\nReport\\nClose"]'::jsonb,
