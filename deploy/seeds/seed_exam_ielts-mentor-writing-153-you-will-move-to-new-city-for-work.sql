It’s been a while since we''ve written to each other. You''ll be glad to hear that I''ll move to London soon to take a job that I''ve been offered at Liberty Global. I''ll reach London in a few weeks.\nAs you know, I''ve never been to London, and I am hoping you could help me in finding suitable accommodation. Though my company has arranged a studio apartment for the first two weeks, I''ll have to vacate the place after that.\nMy preference would be to live close to my workplace, which is in central London, as it would save a lot of time. If I could get something near the tube station and the marketplace, that would be great. I''m mostly looking for a furnished studio apartment. If the studio apartment is not available, I would not mind sharing a flat with a girl. But the apartment should be spacious with a good ventilation facility. My budget is around $1000 pounds for the studio apartment and half of that for the shared room. Do you think I will get something in that budget?\nI know you have a wide social circle there, and I would really appreciate your time to find me suitable accommodation.\nLooking forward to meeting you soon.\nWarm wishes,\nPreeti\n[ by Preeti]\nSample Answer 2:\nDear Justin,\nHope this letter finds you in good health. I''m writing to let you that I have accepted a new job in California and I would be working with Optus Corporation from the next month. As you know I have never been to California so I am seeking your help in finding accommodation.\nMy office is near the bay area of San Francisco and I shall prefer an apartment with a single bedroom in this vicinity. The apartment should have an attached bathroom and a small kitchen. I would not mind the rent if the location is near my office. I would like to live somewhere new, so something in a modern apartment block would be great. My budget for the accommodation is between 800 to 1400 dollars.\nAs you have always lived in this city, you must know the place well. Perhaps you can ask a few friends for a recommendation for such a living place and talk to the landlord about the rent. I would really appreciate your help.\nHope to see you soon. Take care.\nWarm wishes,\nNamrata\n[ by Namrata]',

It would be an absolute delight to live in your city as I would be able to frequently meet you. I would like to ask if you can help me find a living place before I arrive.\\nI believe you could help me to find somewhere to live in as you have a wide social circle. Ideally, I would like to live close to my workplace which happens to be in the Bank area in Brisbane. If this is not possible, my second preference is the downtown district. As I do exercise regularly, it would be great to be near a park too.\\nObviously, I will be looking for a flat, rather than a house, as it is just going to be me and I won’t be able to afford too much. So, a place with one bedroom is fine, but I would like to have a private bathroom, a kitchen. I would prefer to live somewhere new, so anything in a modern apartment block would be great.\\nI look forward to meeting you soon.\\nYours sincerely,\\nAlan Martin", "Dear Mr Khalid,\\nHope you are in the best of health. You would be glad to hear that I will be moving to Saudi Arabia for a new job in a private company that I have been offered recently. I will arrive in Riyadh city in two months and will require your help to find suitable accommodation as I have to join the company next March.\\nI would like my living place to be near my office which is in the city centre as I do not want to commute a long distance daily. The location, if possible, should have a park and a supermarket nearby so that I can spend my free time jogging around and buy groceries easily.\\nI would like to live in an apartment rather than a large house because it will be cheaper. A parking facility is a must as I plan to buy a car. Also, I would like access to a sports club to play sports during weekends.\\nI am sure you can help me find a good place so that I can settle down quickly.\\nBest regards,\\nMubashir Mehdi\\n("]'::jsonb,
