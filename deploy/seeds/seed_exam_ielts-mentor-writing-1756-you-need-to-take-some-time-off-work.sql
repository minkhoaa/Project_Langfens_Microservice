The whole family, including my nephews and nieces, and almost 50 other guests are expected to be present and it demands a huge preparation.\\nTo participate in this occasion, I would need to be away from work for three days, considering the travel time and some preparation works that I am expected to finish before the party.

As you know, we have been working as the best team on the Reliance project for the last six months, and I have stayed up late many nights to complete the project.\\nI am utterly delighted to know that we did well as a team and achieved the target. Unfortunately, those working days and nights have stressed me out and affected badly on my health. I think I need some rest to overcome the exhaustion.

I hope you will grant me the leave and allow me to take the lead of the upcoming projects.\\nLooking forward to your positive response.\\nYours sincerely,\\nShilpa Ray\\nTips: Always write your full name at the end of the letter in a semi-formal or formal letter. When you write an informal letter (ie. a letter to your friend, write your last name only while signing off).\\nReply\\nQuote\\nDeva\\n7 years\\nLetter Question:You are working for a company.

In your letter: - explain why you want to take time off work - give details of the amount of time you need - suggest how your work could be covered while you are awayWrite at least 150 words.Answer: Dear Mr Sanjeev Roy,I am writing to seek your permission for a fortnight leave from work starting from 1st January to prepare for the final assessment of my Master’s Degree course in Data Science.As you are aware, last December I enrolled for this 1-year course, and my final examination is on 29th January. My project work is due for submission by 22nd January, which is almost final with a few improvements to be made. In addition, I need to prepare for the examination as well. As you will agree, the past two months were very hectic at work; hence I couldn’t put enough effort into my studies.I have ensured that there are no more crucial deliveries pending. Also, I have done the transition to my team members to take up all the activities during my absence. Since this is an embargo period, I believe there won’t be any critical project deliveries. I realize my temporary absence will be an inconvenience to you and for the team, but in the long run, it will be beneficial for us. This will enable us to take up projects on Analytics area in which we are relying completely on our vendors. I look forward to hearing from you soon regarding this.Yours sincerely,Deva Panigrahi\\nReply\\nQuote\\nNons\\n7 years 2 months\\nVery well organised. Thumbs Up!\\nReply\\nQuote\\nChamp\\n7 years 4 months\\nDear Mr Jones,I am writing to request a month off work to complete my university exams which are scheduled from September 1st to September 10th 2018. I am hoping that you would permit me to take the leave and complete my PhD qualification. As informed earlier, I have been pursuing the PhD course in \\"Artificial Oceanic Intelligence Research\\" at the Yale Univerity, London, in the evening classes for the past two years. I have been regularly attending my classes and exams after office hours and also during the weekends. After two years, it is mandatory for every student to take the final exam to complete the course and obtain the degree. I would require some time off from work to prepare exclusively for the exams and concentrate on achieving a good score.This would not only help me in my career growth but also my knowledge on the research topic would be an added advantage for our company''s equipment development, which involves building an efficient machine prototype for cleaning the plastic wastage in the ocean.I am sure my absence from the office would cause you a great inconvenience. Therefore, I have requested my colleagues - ''Rachael'' and ''Joanna'', to address any network related issues that I usually look after. They are ready to share some of my other responsibilitie s as well. Once I get back, I will work for extra hours daily and also during the weekends and cover all the lagged work and be up-to-date with the project''s progress. Thank you kindly in advance for granting me the leave.Your''s faithfully,Andr ew Mathew\\nReply\\nQuote\\nRaisa Catunda\\n8 years 8 months\\nIf I am writing to my manager, regarding my opinion on a specific topic.
