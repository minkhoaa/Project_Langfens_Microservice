I would be grateful if you could arrange a tenant for my extra room.\\nI own a flat in Manhattan, and it is on 10th avenue. My flat is located on the 4th floor, and it is quite spacious. It contains 2 moderately large bedrooms, a storage room, a kitchen, and 2 bathrooms. In addition, it is fully furnished with branded furniture and household appliances. I live alone in this apartment and use one bedroom while the second bedroom has no use for me. This is why I have decided to lease it out to someone.\\nThe rent is $450 per month including utility bills. The tenant must be a polite person and a non-smoker. Additionally, he should not have frequent guests and parties. I am sure the prospective student will feel comfortable in this accommodation.\\nI look forward to hearing from you soon.\\nYours cordially,\\nFadi Al-Damiri\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 4.94 (8 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nGT Writing Task 1\\nFormal Letter\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\n×\\nReport\\nReport\\nClose"]'::jsonb,
