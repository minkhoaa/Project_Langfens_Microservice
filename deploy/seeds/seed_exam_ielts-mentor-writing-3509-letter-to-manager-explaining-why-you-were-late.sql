  E'["Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI am writing to explain why I was late to the office for the last week. But first, I would like to apologize to you for failing to show up at work on time during these past few days.\\nDuring the last week, I needed to take my elderly mother to a clinic in the morning time in order to offer her physical therapy to treat her chronic arthritis pain which has become worse in recent days. To further compound the situation, my wife has been out of the town for almost the whole last week for some professional training, arranged by her office, which means I alone had to take care of all kinds of household works, including cooking and cleaning, at home for my whole family.\\nSo, as you can see from the explanation above, my whole last week has been very hectic which caused me to arrive late at my work. But,  please rest assured that I will be at work on time from now on. I hope you will accept my apology and explanation for the unintentional delay.\\nYours faithfully,\\nGreg Timothy\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 3.75 (12 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nGT Writing Task 1\\nExplanation-letter\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\nHijab Ahmed\\n2 years 9 months\\nYour advice really helps me a lot.\\nReply\\nQuote\\nAlia\\n5 years 3 months\\nExcellent sample.
