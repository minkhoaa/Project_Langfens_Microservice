  E'["Dear Mr Hudson,\\nI am Elizabeth Beth, your tenant in apartment C1-5. I am writing to notify you of the unbearable noise the new tenant of C1-3 is making which I have endured for the last couple of days with patience. I am hoping that you would talk to this neighbour and settle the issue.\\nI consider myself lucky to have some great neighbours and never complained to you about any disturbance. However, the new resident on C1-3 is making life tougher for me. They moved in two weeks ago and I am already forced to write you this complaint letter. They have parties almost every day and play music at a higher volume. I go to bed at around 10.30 pm only to wake up again by the loud noise from their flat. I am not sure if this is something I should mention but the family members have nasty quarrels and they do not keep it inside their house. I live with a teenage daughter and a husband who are equally agitated.\\nI think it would be inappropriate for me to personally intervene, and that is why I am relying on you for a solution. You should talk to other tenants on the same floor and get to know what really is happening. You have the authority to talk to the tenant of C1-3 and try to solve the problem. Otherwise, I would be forced to shift to a new residence.\\nExpecting your cooperation in this regard.\\nYours sincerely,\\nElizabeth Beth", "Dear Mr William,\\nHope this letter finds you in good health and spirit. I am writing this letter to you in order to bring your attention to an unpleasant issue that I have been facing lately.\\nI just wanted to let you know that one of your tenants, who has recently moved into apartment 5-D, has been making a lot of noise. Not to mention, the noise becomes louder during the nighttime, especially, when I try to sleep. By the way, it is not only me but other tenants on the same floor who are also complaining about it. And we tried to talk to him politely about the noise issue but the loud music and loud arguments over the phone only keep growing. Anyway, I am sorry to sound like complaining too much, but the noise is bothering me severely since I can not sleep at night.\\nTherefore, I would highly appreciate it if you could please ask our new neighbour not to make any noise after 8.00 at night. But, if that does not work, please allow me to move to another apartment which is on a different floor.\\nYours sincerely,\\nRick Tyson\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 4.54 (14 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nGT Writing Task 1\\nSemi-formal Letter\\nComplaints-letter\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\nNeha\\n6 years 1 month\\nI am so thankful for the help you are providing.
