  E'["Dear Mr George,\\nI am writing to express my interest in working at our company headquarters in the United Kingdom for a few months to further enhance my skills and get exposure to the global market trends of our products so that I can better contribute to my company and carry out my responsibilities more efficiently.\\nAs you know, I have been recently promoted to the assistant product manager post and I am working hard to collaborate with my team to enhance the sales and increase our brand reputation.

I am hoping that you will allow me to take the opportunity to work in our head office for about half a year.\\nI believe that working at the head office would allow me to gain a deeper understanding of our global operations and learn best practices from senior colleagues. This experience would enhance my skills and enable me to bring new insights and strategies back to our team. Additionally, it would give me the chance to build stronger relationships with key stakeholders, which could be beneficial for our department in the long run.\\nTo ensure that my responsibilities are managed smoothly during my absence, I propose delegating some of my tasks to James, who is already familiar with my ongoing projects. I would also be happy to offer remote support when needed and ensure a thorough handover before I leave.\\nI would appreciate your guidance in arranging this transfer and discussing any formal procedures that need to be completed. Please let me know a convenient time to discuss this further.\\nYours sincerely,\\nLiam Bennett", "Dear Mr Jacob,\\nI am writing this letter to inform you about my desire to work in our company’s head office in Amsterdam for about six months.\\nRecently, our company has announced an extensive training programme on the techniques of developing new accounting software for mid-size business firms, and I would like to avail this opportunity. Our company now develops such software for only small firms at our local office and soon we will need to target large business entities.\\nThe training programme is to be held at our head office from 10th of the next July. I would also like to add here that this particular training programme may prove out to be quite important for a software development team leader like me in showing the way to the junior team members and managing larger projects in the future.\\nI have already talked to my project manager to help my team members carry on their routine work without any hurdles, and he assured me that he would jump in to fill the void within the team in my absence. So, it would be great if you could arrange for my transfer so that I can join the training programme and bring innovations to our team.\\nYours sincerely,\\nJohn Andrew\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 4.25 (42 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nGT Writing Task 1\\nOfficial-letter\\nLetter to office manager\\nLetter Writing Sample\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\nArsalan Aslam\\n5 years 10 months\\nDear Mr George,\\nI am writing this letter to request your recommendation for sending me on secondment at our company’s head office in Canada.\\nI have been working under your supervision for almost 3 years. Under your mentorship, I have learned several business aspects of the local market. As you are aware that I have just completed my MBA in International Business and I think in order to substantiate my learning practically, working overseas at the company’s head office will be beneficial not only for me but also for the company itself as I will also be able to share my local experience with personnel at the company''s headquarter.\\nAs I will be on secondment of six months, I have already trained my subordinate colleague Ahsan Khan to look after the matters I currently deal with at the company here. Moreover, I will be in contact with you, Ahsan, and other colleagues via email and conference call if my assistance is required.\\nI would appreciate it if you recommend me for this secondment and help me in making the necessary arrangements.\\nI look forward to your cooperation.\\nYours sincerely,\\nArsalan Aslam\\nReply\\nQuote\\nSahaj\\n5 years 11 months\\nDear Mr Shelton,\\nI am writing to express my interest to work at the company''s headquarters in Chennai, for about 6 months.
