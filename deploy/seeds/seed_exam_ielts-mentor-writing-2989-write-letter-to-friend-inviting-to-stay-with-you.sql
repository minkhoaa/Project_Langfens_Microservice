  E'["Dear Annie,\\nHope you are doing well by the grace of the Almighty. Let me tell you how happy and pleased I''m to learn that you will be visiting a place near my hometown on a business trip within a few months. You''ll also be glad to know that I''ve told my family about how we became such good friends after meeting with each other on a holiday tour.\\nAnyway, it is exciting to learn about your business trip near my hometown. It would be even nicer if could make an arrangement and stay with me for a couple of days before leaving for your home. By the way, I live in a nice and reasonably quiet town, minus the hectic lifestyle of a busy city, and so I think that you would enjoy it here. Besides, I already have made plans to visit a few places like a world-class movie theatre, a nice public park with a big lake in it and of course, a couple of upscale restaurants where food is just so awesome. So, please let me know what you think about my plan.\\nCan''t wait to meet you.\\nWarm wishes,\\nHelen\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 4.35 (13 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nInformal Letter\\nPersonal Letter\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\nPreesha\\n1 year 3 months\\nGood.\\nReply\\nQuote\\nAbdulaziz\\n2 years 4 months\\nDear Alexander,\\nI''m thrilled to hear from you and learn that you''ll be visiting Kashkadarya next month.

I recently met you during my last vacation which I hope you remember. We stayed at Royal Hotel South in New Jersey and had some fun time together. I am exhilarated to know that you are coming to my neighbourhood for some official business and I am very much looking forward to meeting you.
