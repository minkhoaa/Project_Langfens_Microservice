However, the card was missing from the envelope.Write a letter to the bank''s head office. In your letter:» explain why you are writing» express concern about the missing card» ask them what they intend to doYou should write at least 150 words.Answer: Dear sir/ madam,I am writing to complain about the missing bank card and about the letter I received from the bank to acknowledge my receiving of the card. I applied for a new credit card a couple of weeks ago and I was supposed to get it last week. Surprisingly, I got a letter from the bank three days ago and there was no card enclosed! Since the envelope had not been opened, I assume that the card was not included in the first place and this holds the bank responsible for this terrible mistake. Moreover, yesterday, I received another letter from the bank that had a form enclosed which expects me to acknowledge my consent that I received the credit card. I called Customer Service at once but unfortunately, no one was able to give me a reasonable explanation. Now I am really concerned about my missing credit card and I demand that you stop this card immediately due to the possible misuse. I also demand that you acknowledge the receipt of this letter and proper action immediately. Looking forward to your prompt response.Yours faithfully,ABC\\nReply\\nQuote\\nMd Dalour\\n10 years 11 months\\nThe letter you write is nice.
