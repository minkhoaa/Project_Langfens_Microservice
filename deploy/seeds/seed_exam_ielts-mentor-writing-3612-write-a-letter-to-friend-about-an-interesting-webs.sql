  E'["Dear Victor,\\nHope all is well at your end. I just quickly wanted to share some interesting information – information about a website that is – with you.\\nI know that you''re very much interested in growing mushrooms in your backyard. So, this particular website, called “growmushroom.net”, would probably come to your rescue since it covers just about all sorts of information about growing mushrooms. All you need to do is click on the “our works” page from the main menu, and it will take you to the information you would need.\\nHowever, while this particular website would be useful for just about anybody who is interested in growing mushrooms on a small scale, it would be particularly helpful for you since it talks a lot about how to successfully grow them in the areas where the weather is rather dry, and if I remember correctly, the weather is dry where you live. By the way, I came to learn about this “cool” looking website on the internet in the process of trying to find a cool theme for a “gardening” related website which I am supposed to develop for one of my clients. Though I do not use the website, I''m sure it would be helpful to you.\\nWarm wishes,\\nMitchel", "Dear Spencer,\\nHope you''re doing fine. Today I''m writing to tell you about a fascinating website that I''ve found recently and have been using ever since!\\nThe URL of this website is fooddecider.net, and it''s basically a website that helps users decide on a menu or a food item. A week or so ago, I looked at Google to choose between two menus and this website popped up in the Google search result. Now I feel lucky that I have found it. Since I know how much you love to eat healthy food and often get confused about what to eat for lunch or dinner. I believe it can help you immensely. Moreover, it is fun and informative at the same time.\\nWhenever you enter the name of a menu or food item in its user-friendly interface, it will explain the food values of that item or menu and let you know how many calories you are going to consume. It will also advise you on what menus to avoid and at what time of the day. Moreover, if you are undecided between two sets of menus or items, it will pick one for you based on the nutritious values. And that is exactly how I use it. I simply enter a food name or input two menus, and it does the rest for me.\\nI hope you''d like it as much as I do. Hope to see you soon.\\nYours truly,\\nIvan\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 3.68 (14 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nGT Writing Task 1\\nInformal Letter\\nPersonal Letter\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\nPR\\n3 years 4 months\\nWrite a letter to a friend telling him/her about an interesting website that you have found recently.\\nIn your letter,\\n- say how you found it\\n- how it can help\\n- how you use it\\nWrite at least 150 words.\\nSample Letter:\\nDear Laila,\\nHope you and your family are doing well. It’s been a long time since we last met in person. Today, I''m writing to share a wonderful website with you, which I''ve started using recently.\\nLast week I was learning guitar online, and I came across an advertisement in between the lessons. They mentioned a cryptocurrency named “Bitcoin”, and a platform where one can trade the same.\\nI have logged in to the website and created my account. This website allows individuals to purchase and sell the cryptocurrency across the world. So, now, if you want to send money to your younger brother studying in Canada, you can just buy some bitcoin via this exchange and transfer the same to him via the same website in 5 minutes. There is no need to go to a bank or a money transfer entity like the Western Union.\\nI''ve been using it to transfer money to my sister in the USA, and it''s reliable and very fast. Also, the transaction rate is high while the transfer fee is a bare minimum. I will send you a referral link to sign up for an account, and you''ll get a welcome bonus of USD 10.\\nDo give it a shot.\\nBest Regards,\\nSumeet\\nReply\\nQuote\\nSurinder Singh\\n3 years 6 months\\nMore.\\nReply\\nQuote\\n×\\nReport\\nReport\\nClose"]'::jsonb,
