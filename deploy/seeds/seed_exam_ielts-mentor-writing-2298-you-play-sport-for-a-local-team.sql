  E'["Dear Ahmed,\\nHow are you now? I was shocked to hear that you fell off the stairs all of a sudden and have had an injury to your foot. I am feeling very sorry for your condition as it happened right before an important match on Sunday. I wish you a quick recovery.\\nI heard from our coach that you are under observation by a team of doctors at Jinnah hospital. One of my relatives works there as a medical practitioner and I will request him to visit you sometime. Do not worry at all as the hospital has an exceptional reputation due to its well-trained staff and modern equipment. However, I would like to know your personal opinion about the way the hospital staff are treating you. Is there anything you want us to do for you?\\nI want to share some exciting news with you. You have been selected in the national football team as a lead striker. In addition to this, our university has announced a full-fee scholarship to acknowledge your efforts in sports. I wish you good health and will visit you soon.\\nWarm wishes,\\nFahad\\n[", "Dear Brian,\\nI hope that you are feeling well and trying to make the best out of the worst situation. I have just heard the news about your accident from our team manager over the phone, and I must say that I was quite shocked to hear the sad news.\\nI would certainly like to ask you about how the accident took place, or what exactly you were doing at the time of the accident, but I guess that I better save the questions for now. Anyway, from what I heard from our team manager, I am assuming that your left leg has signs of some fractures, but you can’t be sure unless an X-ray of your leg is taken. So, what kind of treatment are you receiving at the hospital now? Are you feeling comfortable there?\\nBy the way, you will be glad to know that our whole team has finally got permission to practise swimming in that big swimming pool in the city centre, where you have always wanted to go. I am sure that we will go there sometime once you are recovered. That is all for now.\\nBest wishes,\\nJoseph\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 4.33 (18 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nInformal Letter\\nPersonal Letter\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\n×\\nReport\\nReport\\nClose"]'::jsonb,
