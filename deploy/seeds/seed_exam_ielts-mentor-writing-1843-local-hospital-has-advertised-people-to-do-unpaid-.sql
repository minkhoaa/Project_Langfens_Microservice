  E'["Dear Sir or Madam,\\nIn response to a recent advertisement broadcast on television, I would like to offer myself as an enlistee for the unpaid work at your hospital. I consider this a great chance to serve the patients and best utilise my spare time for humanitarian works. I am hoping that you would let me offer my service.\\nMy parents are doctors and they devote their professional lives to serve people and society as a whole. I am highly inspired by them and want to do something of my own for people who need care. What can be a better place to assist people than in a hospital? Moreover, I have around two hours to spare each day in the evening and I live nearby. I would like to best use the superfluous hours of my daily routine in philanthropic work. I have previous experiences of doing some voluntary works for our community.\\nI can assist a professional nurse, take care of babies, help patients to move and bring them meals. I am, in reality, ready to learn to do any type of work to help people in this hospital. I can work from 5:00 pm to 7:00 pm every day except on Saturday.\\nHope you hear your positive response and start my work soon.\\nYours faithfully,\\nSara Sandler", "Dear Sir or Madam,\\nIt is magnificent to see such an admirable initiative on your part to motivate people to do some unpaid work to help your hospital in our town. While the advertisement does not exactly say what kind of unpaid work for which you are seeking help, I think that I could still be a part of this great initiative, simply because it would allow me to help ill people in the hospital while utilising my spare time to do something good for others.\\nBesides, this little unpaid work experience would enable me to learn something noble that I would be able to use for the rest of my life. Again, I understand that you have not asked to fill in any specific vacant job positions in your advertisement, but I would surely love to assist a nurse or a doctor in taking the temperature of patients as well as checking their blood pressure to name a few ways I can help them.\\nSo, please consider me for the position of an ''unpaid worker'' as it would not only allow me to gain some valuable experience but also help your regular staff to reduce some of their extra workloads. By the way, I am available to work every day from Monday to Friday from 4.00 pm to 7.30 pm.\\nYours faithfully,\\nAdrian Farrel\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 4.29 (17 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nGT Writing Task 1\\nFormal Letter\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\nMuhammad Azhar\\n3 years 10 months\\nKindly send me the GT writing task for preparation materials.

I am writing in connection with the advertisement in the ‘Californi a Times’ newspaper about voluntary work in your hospital. I would like to apply for this work. Allow me to elaborate in details.\\nI am going to complete my nursing course in a few months and anticipating placement activities. I would like to gain some experience in the field of Nursing as well as serve people who need assistance. I heard that some eminent persons are working in your hospital. Therefore, I am quite confident that, working in your organisation will be a breakthrough in my life, and enable me to help people in need.\\nMy final term examination will be about practical sessions, dealing with patients and interacting with them real-time. Therefore, it will be excellent if you could provide some voluntary work in your hospital. I can work as a part-time nurse and would be able to take care of patients.\\nI often get free time in the evening, after my classes, which I want to spend constructively. I feel quite enthusiastic about working in night shifts in your hospital from the starting of the next week. I hope, you would allow me to work in your hospital.\\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\\nYours faithfully,\\nSteve Anne\\nReply\\nQuote\\nPriya\\n6 years 3 months\\nDear Sir/Madam,\\nI am writing in response to your advertisement published in yesterday’s Times of India, regarding volunteer work for the hospital in our vicinity. I am keen to do the same in my spare time.\\nSince childhood, I have had great respect for Mother Teresa and wanted to follow her footsteps. Consequently, I had completed my nursing diploma from \\"All India Institute of Medical Science\\" last year and I think it would be a great opportunity for me to utilise my skills, help the needy and also to enhance my experience.\\nSince I have completed my nursing course, I can take care of patients, provide them with basic medications, do dressing/ bandages and provide emotional support to them and their families. Moreover, I can also work for long hours if required in case of emergencies.\\nDuring weekdays, I am occupied as I am doing a full-time job in a private clinic. However, I will be available on the weekends and can join immediately.\\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\\nYours faithfully,\\nJasleen Priya\\nReply\\nQuote\\nVipin Ahuja\\n6 years 9 months\\nDear Sir or Madam,I am writing this letter with regard to the advertisement published in a local newspaper for volunteering in the hospital. I would like to inform you that I have an acute interest in helping people in need. I want to take the opportunity to do this unpaid work because helping people in a hospital who need help has always satiated me and at the same time, I am ardent about it. As aptly said, \\"Helping others is a Life\\". Additionally, I am doing MBBS and can help in the hospital providing medication to the patients. Also, I am experienced in injecting medication which can definitely help to the busy doctors in the hospital. I can also give an awareness session with respect to contagious diseases which will eventually help people to be more healthy. I am available during weekends from noon to 7:00 pm. You can drop me an email at vipina@gmail.com or contact me at +91-8080581008. Looking forward to hearing from you.
