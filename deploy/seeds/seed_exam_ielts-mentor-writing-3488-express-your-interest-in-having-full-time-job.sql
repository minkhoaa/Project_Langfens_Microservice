  E'["Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI am John Vanbrugh, and I work as a part-time Accounting Executive for Rainbow Inc. Recently, I have seen an advertisement, posted on our company’s general notice board, which has asked for a full-time Audit Executive to join your team. I would like to apply for this post.\\nIn defence of my eligibility for this post, I would like to say that I have learned a great deal about the important short term and long term financial goals of our company after working for almost one year in my current role. Besides, I have also prepared some financial reports myself under the supervision of my senior Accounting Manager. And, as far as my educational qualifications are concerned, I have completed my Master’s degree in Economics with a good GPA. But, most importantly, I am already very much familiar with this company''s culture to understand where my contributions are needed the most.\\nSo, I am confident that if you hire me for this position, based on my current role at your company and my qualifications, I surely would be able to render excellent service to the company.\\nYours faithfully,\\nJohn Vanbrugh", "Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI am Stephen Traver, a junior Java programmer at your company. I have been working as a part-timer for the last one and a half years, and have successfully completed more than 6/7 projects so far. Recently, I have noticed a job advertisement on our company website that announces hiring a full-time Java developer. I believe I am eligible for this post and would like you to consider me for this full-time position.\\nI want to take the opportunity to apply for this full-time position because it would mean a better opportunity for me to contribute more to our company while also being rewarded for my work here. Not to mention a full-time position comes with better remuneration and other facilities which would motivate me to work more dedicatedly.\\nI believe I am quite eligible for this post because I have delivered all the projects in time during the past one and a half years and I have developed my skills to a great extent during this time. I am flexible about working hours and can work independently or as a part of a team, based on project demand. I am also a multi-tasker and can work under pressure.\\nSo, I am hoping that you would give me the opportunity to start as a full-time Java developer from the next month in our company and allow me to contribute to our projects more closely and dedicatedly.\\nYours faithfully,\\nStephen Traver\\nTips on completing this letter task:\\nFrom the letter question, you know that you want to\\napply for a full-time job\\nin a company where you already work as a part-time employee. The letter should be\\naddressed to your manager\\n. But it should begin as\\n\\"Dear Sir or Madam\\"\\nrather than \\"Mr Alfred\\", for example, as the instruction clearly tells you how to begin your letter:\\nBegin your letter as follows:\\nDear Sir or Madam,\\nThere are three bullet points in the letter question. You should answer all these three points in your letter answer. The first point is\\n\\"introduce yourself and explain why you are writing\\"\\n. As this is an official letter and your manager would be interested in knowing about your designation, job type, job responsibilities, qualifications and special skills rather than your house address, family, and favourite hobby, keep it strict to your job. Also clearly state why you are writing (ie. I am writing to apply for the position of ...).\\nThe second bullet point is\\n\\"express your interest in having this full-time job\\"\\n. In the second paragraph, give some details of your current job position, how well you are performing and why you would like to apply for this full-time job. You can also mention how you have learned about this job advertisement/announcement, and how much you know about this full-time job.\\nThe Third paragraph should express\\nwhy you think you are the right candidate for this full-time job\\n. Here you need to express some of your qualifications, special skills and achievement in your part-time position to convince your manager to hire you for the full-time job. It is worth mentioning that the full-time job can be in the same position you are working as a part-timer or can be a different position.\\nFinally, sign off your letter. As it is a formal letter, write\\n\\"Yours faithfully\\"\\nrather than \\"Yours sincerely\\" or \\"Yours ever\\".\\nQuick Tips:\\nAvoid using contractions like\\n\\"hasn''t\\", \\"I''m\\", \\"you''re\\"\\nin a formal letter. These are accepted (even recommended) in personal letters, but not in a formal letter.\\nRelated Vocabulary:\\nDelivered:\\nSo far, I have\\ndelivered\\nall the projects in a timely fashion and I have a good reputation for being\\ndisciplined\\n.\\nSupervised:\\nI have\\nsupervised\\na team of ten people in my previous job and I consider myself a great\\nteam player\\n.\\nParticipated:\\nI have\\nparticipated\\nin some training and\\nskill development\\ncourses after I finished my graduation.\\nOn-time:\\nI am always\\non time\\nfor\\norganised events\\n, work-related or otherwise.\\nAchievement:\\nI have\\nidentified\\nand helped my previous company to set up a new system that has\\ntremendously\\nenhanced the output of our office.\\nAutomation:\\nI was a part of the team that played a major role in\\nautomating\\nthe office and its\\nwork process\\n.\\nFlexible:\\nI am\\nflexible\\nin my working hours, being able to work evenings and weekends if required.\\nEnthusiastic:\\nI am\\ndependable\\n,\\nenergetic\\nand\\nenthusiastic\\n, and these qualities help me thrive for\\nexcellence\\n.\\nAble:\\nI am\\nable\\nto work\\nindependently\\nor as a part of a team, based on\\nproject demand\\n.
