Wishing you a great day.\\nYours faithfully,\\nRoger Rodriguez", "Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI am Matthew Hudson, recently organised an all-day meeting for our company - Taylor''s Logistics, at your hotel on 25th November, and I would like to share some feedback from our participants regarding their experience.\\nOverall, the attendees were highly impressed with the hotel’s facilities and service. The meeting room was spacious and well-equipped, the staff were courteous and efficient, and the ambience of the venue was professional yet welcoming. These aspects contributed significantly to the success of our event.\\nHowever, there were several complaints about the food served at lunch. Many participants felt that the variety was limited, with only a few options available. Additionally, the quality did not meet their expectations, as some dishes were bland and lacked freshness. A few guests also mentioned that dietary requirements were not adequately catered for, despite prior requests.\\nTo enhance the dining experience in the future, I would suggest expanding the menu options, ensuring better ingredient quality, and providing clear labels for dietary preferences. I hope these recommendations will help improve the overall experience for future guests.\\nI appreciate your attention to this matter and look forward to your response.\\nYours faithfully,\\nMatthew Hudson", "Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI am writing in connection with the day-long meeting that we organised at your hotel - \\"The Richmond\\", on 28th January 2022. I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for successfully hosting us, and also express our concern about the food quality, which we expect would be better in the future.\\nTwo days ago, I took feedback from the participants who joined the meeting. Although they liked the hotel, including its facilities and the services of your affable staff, many of them complained about the food we were served. Indeed, some of the menu items that were served during the lunch were not properly cooked, and we did not enjoy the taste and aroma of the food. Soup and bread were served cold, and that was unexpected. The lack of western food items on the menu was surprising to some of the participants.\\nI believe you should take steps so that all the dishes are cooked properly and served in time. I also recommend that you add some western dishes to your menu.\\nI wish you a good day and hope that you will consider my suggestions.\\nYours faithfully,\\nBrian Marsh\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 4.50 (10 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nGT Writing Task 1\\nFormal Letter\\nComplaints-letter\\nLetter Writing Sample\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\nSamer Omar\\n4 years 7 months\\nQuestion:\\nYou recently organised an all-day meeting for your company, which took place in a local hotel.

Besides, the receptionists were extremely helpful and well-behaved. Moreover, I want to thank you for the pleasant arrangements and decoration at the conference venue.\\nOn the flip side, although the main dishes were fairly good, the dessert and salads were a disaster - ice-cream was molten and jelly was completely tart. Furthermore, the vegetables in salads were neither properly cleaned nor fresh. I believe the food in the previous meeting was much better than this one.\\nIn order to enhance the service in the hotel’s restaurant, I think it would be great if the kitchen assistants could ensure the cleanliness and freshness of the food. Furthermore, it would be better to hire more professional cooks and food specialists.\\nI hope you would consider my feedback. I look forward to carrying out more meetings in your hotel in the future.\\nYours faithfully,\\nSamer Omar\\nReply\\nQuote\\nVishal Trehan\\n5 years 1 month\\nYou recently organised an all-day meeting for your company, which took place in a local hotel.

We booked the conference room, and the lunch was served in the lawn area. Overall we had a nice time there, and the staff liked your hospitality. But, they had some complaints about the food that was served.\\nYour hotel is located in a quiet and calm location. Moreover, the green surroundings and the blend of forest theme-based architecture enhances the ambience of the place to another level. The spacious conference rooms, appropriate seating arrangements and the quality of the sound systems made the whole event fruitful. Staff also liked the neat and clean restrooms, and the lush green lawns, where lunch was served. Moreover, your staff was very courteous and knowledgeable.\\nHowever, our staff was unhappy with the food quality. As it was a sunny day, the absence of canopies made it difficult for the people to have lunch in the open. Moreover, the quality and variety of food served were not up to the mark. Some vegetables were served half-cooked, and the desert was not chilled. This incident ruined the good experience which my colleagues had in the earlier part of the day.\\nI would like to suggest that you should appoint more responsible food supervisors for such events. There should not be any let-go attitude while serving the food. The food supervisor should first check the quality of the food then nod to serve to the guests. Also, please add more variety to your menu so that more choices to eat are available for the guests.\\nI am hoping that this feedback will help improve the quality of stay and food experience for the visitors in future.\\nThank and Regards\\nVishal Trehan\\nReply\\nQuote\\n×\\nReport\\nReport\\nClose"]'::jsonb,
