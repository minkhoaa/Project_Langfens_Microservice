  E'["Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI am writing to inform you that I wish to move into a new accommodation next term, preferably in a single room, as I find my current sharing arrangement quite inconvenient. My roommate has made it harder for me to concentrate on my studies and I am hoping you would help me sort it out.\\nDue to my roommate’s inconsiderate behaviour, I find it troublesome to live in my room, let alone study properly. For one thing, he has friends visiting him every single day, for another, he regularly holds parties and listens to music loudly. In addition, he often borrows my belongings without my permission. A few days ago he took a book from my desk and lost it which I borrowed from the college library. Due to his irrational behaviours, I find it challenging to concentrate on my studies and live peacefully.\\nI am expecting your help to move into a room of my own, where I will be free from such distractions. I would be grateful if you could find a single room for me near the college campus from the beginning of next term. I will be always indebted to you.\\nYours faithfully,\\nRichard Heer", "Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI am writing to request you to allow me to move into another room, preferably to a single room, from next term as I find my current accommodation arrangement quite inconvenient.\\nI enrolled in the B. Tech course in your college last January and currently sharing my room, 308, with a fellow mate who is also pursuing the same course. My roommate brings his friends almost every day and holds frequent parties. It not only hinders my studies but also breaches my privacy. He often borrows my things without asking and he even lost a valuable item last month. His activities are not friendly and I find it hard to concentrate on my studies due to his irrational behaviours.\\nMy father, despite his financial crunch, did arrange for my higher studies in this reputed college. It is my moral responsibility not to lose sight of the dreams which have been conceived in the eyes of my parents. The latest incident wherein he borrowed my laptop without my permission forced me to bring these issues to your attention.\\nIn view of all these undesirable and uncomfortable situations, I once again humbly request you to allow me a new room next term, preferably a single room.\\nYours faithfully,\\nKim Neeraj\\n[", "Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI am writing to express my dissatisfaction and dilemmas with the current accommodation arrangement I have at my college. My roommate''s absurd activities are negatively affecting my studies and I would like to move into a single room next term which completely depends on your kind permission.\\nAlthough my current room is nice to live in with proper amenities, I am not satisfied with the irrational attitude and carelessness of my housemate. He has an antipathy towards cleaning the room. Moreover, he has a big social circle and invites friends to the room on a regular basis. They listen to loud music, sometimes hold parties and play computer games which create a commotion that disturbs me and interrupts my studies. Furthermore, he has a tendency to use my personal belongings without my permission. In the last few months, I have lost some of my valuables from the room and I am not sure who should I blame!\\nI would like to live in a single room so that I can have freedom of work and study. My final exam is approaching and I want to prepare for it without any interference. I hope you would be kind enough to understand my issues related to my roommate and would arrange a new room next semester.\\nI hope to hear a positive response from you soon.\\nYours faithfully,\\nFahad Sultan\\n[", "Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI am writing to express my utter dissatisfaction with my current college accommodation, mainly due to my housemate''s absurd routine that severely disrupts my studies. I am hoping you would kindly allow me to move into a single room next term so that I can study properly and live harmoniously.\\nAs you know, I stay in room 625 with a roommate in our college''s science block. The room is nice and spacious. However, my roommate has a wide social circle and he invites visitors almost daily, which makes the room overcrowded. Besides, he holds parties now and then, which often last till midnight or early morning. This makes it impossible for me to focus on my studies. To make the situation worse, he uses my belonging even without asking and often damages them.\\nI hope this matter will receive your immediate attention as it is seriously hampering my studies. I would appreciate it if you could arrange a single room for me from the beginning of the next semester as I have a habit of studying in a silent atmosphere.\\nThanking you in advance for your kind cooperation. I look forward to hearing from you soon.\\nYours faithfully,\\nMansoor Afzal\\n["]'::jsonb,
