  E'["Dear Johnson,\\nHope all is well at your end. I''m writing this letter to you because I''ve some furniture to sell, and I''d rather have you buy them instead of some complete strangers.\\nI''m trying to sell some furniture because I''m planning to move to another city for some professional reason. I just don’t want to carry them all the way to that city because carrying them that far would most probably damage them. So, I thought that it''d be a good idea to let you know about the furniture before I sell them, in case if you would feel interested to buy them.\\nSpeaking of which, the furniture includes a few chairs, made of oak wood, a large dining table, made of mahogany tree, and a couple of sofa chairs. I think that you would like the furniture since they seem to be in good shape and condition. Besides, the prices are also reasonable.\\nSo, please feel free to drop by my place, preferably sometime in the next weekend, so that you can have a look at my furniture and decide whether to purchase them or not.\\nWarm wishes,\\nDavis", "Dear Zhao,\\nI hope you are doing well. I''m writing to let you know that I''m selling some of my furniture, and I thought you might be interested before I advertise it elsewhere.\\nThe reason I am selling some of my furniture is that I''m moving to a smaller apartment next month, and unfortunately, I won’t have enough space for all my current furniture. Instead of storing it, I would rather sell it to someone who could make good use of it.\\nI have a wooden dining table with four matching chairs, a comfortable two-seater sofa in excellent condition, and a modern glass coffee table. All the pieces are in great shape, and I’m happy to offer them to you at a reasonable price.\\nIf you’re interested, you’re welcome to come and have a look. Would this Saturday afternoon work for you? Let me know what time suits you best.\\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\\nWarm wishes,\\nChen", "Dear Rajib,\\nHope you are doing great. I''m writing to let you know that I have decided to sell some of my furniture. I will move to a new city soon and my new apartment is not big enough to accommodate all of my furniture. I thought you might be interested to buy some of the furniture I have planned to sell.\\nYou know that I''ve recently been transferred to Rajshahi. It''s great news for me because I have wished to live there for a long. However, there''s a problem- the new flat is smaller than my current one and I will need to sell some of my furniture. More specifically, I want to sell my dining and sofa set.\\nLast month, you came to my house on the occasion of my younger daughter''s birthday. I remember you inquiring about the dining table and the sofa set and I thought you might want to have those. Nevertheless, it''s a large dining table including six chairs made of mahogany wood. Besides, the sofa I own is a modern fabric Scandinavian sofa set that was placed in my living room. I would rather sell the furniture to someone whom I know than an unknown person, and I''m willing to offer a reasonable price.\\nYou can come anytime you want and inspect the furniture. If you feel that they are perfect for you, you can buy those. Don''t worry about the price.\\nNo more today, speak to you soon.\\nWarm wishes,\\nRahim\\n("]'::jsonb,
