I am interested in renting out a room to a tenant, preferably a student, and would like you to publish the advert on 24th and 25th May in your daily newspaper.\nThe room I intend to rent out is fully furnished, currently vacant and comes with an attached bathroom and a balcony. The apartment is on the 4th floor, approximately 185 square feet and is located on Raspberry street. The rent per month would be $580 including the utility bills. The occupant of the room would be free to use the kitchen and the common room and can move into the apartment at the beginning of June.\nI would like to rent it out to a university student who is a non-smoker, would have less frequent visitors and like to live quietly. If this is not possible, I can rent it out to a service holder but he or she has to be single and fulfil other criteria. A deposit of two months has to be made and I must mention that I can not assure a car parking in the garage.\nAs I have mentioned, I would like to have the advert published in your newspaper''s classified section on 24th and 25th May. I have written the exact text of the advertisement in a separate paper and it does not exceed the word limit of 200. Please publish it on a 4X6 inch box with general format and text. I would be ready to pay once you approve the advert to be published. I can pay using my credit card or send you an account payable check.\nThank you in advance for your cooperation.\nYours faithfully,\nTesla Johnson',
