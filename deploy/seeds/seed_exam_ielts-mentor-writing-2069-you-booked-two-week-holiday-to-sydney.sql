  E'You Booked Two Week Holiday To Sydney',
  E'You should spend about\n20\nminutes on this task.\nYou booked a two-week holiday to Sydney with a tour agency. You are not happy with the holiday – the flight was delayed, the hotel was noisy, and so on.\nWrite to the tour agency to complain about the holiday giving details about the problems. Request some compensation or refund.\nYou should write at least\n150\nwords.\nYou do\nNOT\nneed to write any addresses.\nBegin your letter as follows:\nDear Sir or Madam\n,\nModel\nAnswer 1:\nDear Sir or Madam,\nTwo months ago I booked a tour package from your agency and travelled to Sydney on 23rd July I was excited when I booked the tour but very disappointed to find that your agency did not keep its promises. I am hoping you will probe the issue and refund me the $780 that I had to spent personally due to the mismanagement by your employees.\nIn relation to the specifics of the package I opted in, I booked the exclusive two-week-long tour package to Sydney on May 12th and paid $2800 in cash. I am attaching a copy of my receipt and confirmation slip with this letter. The package includes a fortnight tour to Sydney inclusive of roundtrip flights, four-star hotel accommodation, tour guides, breakfasts, sightseeing tours and a few other recreational activities.\nThe issue with the tour is that we did not get the services we were promised. The departure flight your agency booked were delayed for almost 3 hours and landed at a different airport than assured. On top of that, we were taken to a two-star hotel and the quality of its service was below standard. I did not pay for a two-star hotel and want an explanation of this mismanagement and false claim.\nAs a solution, and because I do not want to start a legal fight if you are willing to take action, I am hoping that you will agree to refund me the $780 that I was forced to spend. If I do not hear back from you in regards to this within a week, I will be forced to take legal actions, which by all means I would like to avoid with your cooperation.\nThank you for giving the matter your attention and I hope to hear your reply soon.\nYours faithfully,\nWesley Phillip',

  E'["Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI took a tour package you offered and travelled to Sydney on 25th July. I was looking forward to an exciting tour but was disappointed with the quality of service your company has provided. I am hoping that you would refund half of the amount I paid as compensation as your company failed to keep promises.\\nIn relation to the package I opted for, I booked a holiday package to Sydney and it was a fortnight tour package. I paid $1600 in cash and was promised a top class two-way fight, three-star hotel accommodation, tour guide, transportation and meals.\\nI was promised a dream vacation but everything went wrong. Not only the flight was delayed for four hours but the hotel, which was arranged for us, was below standard with low-quality service and noise issues round the clock. The bus tour was also cancelled for no apparent reason. Moreover, the meals were tasteless and I had to pay for the meals despite the meal inclusive package I opted in. This is unacceptable.\\nAs a solution, and since your company did not respect the commitments it made to us, I expect a 50% refund from your company for all the charges that I had paid in advance. If I do not hear from in within the next seven days, I will file a formal complaint to the Consumer Rights Authority against your company with regards to false claims.\\nI hope to have prompt action on my complaint and expect a refund soon.\\nYours faithfully,\\nMubashir Noorani\\n["]'::jsonb,
