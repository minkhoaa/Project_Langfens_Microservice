  E'["Dear Mr Reynold,\\nI am writing to you regarding the complaints about our reception area that we have received over the past few months, and to share my opinion about how to address them.\\nMany visitors stated their dissatisfaction with our reception area and most of the complaints were due to the fact that the place is overcrowded, they often have to wait for a long, and there is no desk to fill in the forms. They also showed their concerns that only one receptionist cannot serve them promptly, and it kills their valuable time waiting and talking to the receptionist.\\nNeedless to say, the area where visitors arrive and wait is extremely important as it represents the image of our company and gives the first impression of the organization. Taking this into consideration, it is highly important to enlarge the reception area by annexing the room next to it. Moreover, it would be a good idea to equip the place with an additional sofa set and a desk for the visitors to use. Finally, hiring a second receptionist would be definitely worthwhile.\\nI am hoping that you would look into the recently lodged complaints and implement the suggested changes to better serve the visitors and keep our reputation intact.\\nYours sincerely,\\nMark Almond", "Dear Mr Abel,\\nI am writing in response to your request for suggestions regarding the reception area. Many complaints have been raised by visitors during the last couple of months, and I hope my suggestions will be helpful to you in deciding a fitting solution to this matter.\\nMany guests have expressed concerns about long waiting times, uncomfortable seating, and a lack of clear signage. Some have also mentioned that the area feels too crowded during peak hours and that the reception staff sometimes seem overwhelmed.\\nThe reception area plays a crucial role in shaping the first impression of our company. It serves as the initial point of contact for clients and business partners, influencing their perception of our professionalism. A well-organised and welcoming space enhances our company’s reputation and ensures a positive visitor experience.\\nTo address these concerns, I suggest adding more seating with ergonomic chairs, implementing a clear queuing system, and placing signs to guide visitors efficiently. Additionally, hiring an extra receptionist during busy periods could help reduce waiting times and improve customer service.\\nI appreciate your attention to this matter and look forward to discussing these improvements further.\\nYours sincerely,\\nEmily Thompson", "Dear Mr Michael,\\nI am writing with regard to the complaints we have received about our reception area over the past few weeks from our visitors. I have personally looked at the complaint logs and would like to share my suggestions to address the problem.\\nPeople who had to deal with our reception area mostly expressed their dissatisfaction about the congestion and delay in getting service. They also vehemently complained about the lack of proper sitting arrangements. Finally, many of them were dissatisfied as we do not have a desk and arrangement for filling in forms in the reception room.\\nNeedless to say, the reception area and the service provided there represent our company''s image. This is the first place where a potential client visits and if we fail to give a good impression, we would surely fail to increase our client base.\\nAs a solution, I would suggest that we need to extend our reception area and hire a second receptionist. Perhaps, we can annex the adjacent room to the existing reception area and provide a desk with papers, pens and other amenities so that visitors can easily fill up the forms.\\nThank you for giving the matter a top priority and I hope you would consider my suggestions to keep our visitors'' complaints to the minimum level.\\nYours sincerely,\\nChristie Barlow\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 4.69 (16 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nGT Writing Task 1\\nOfficial-letter\\nLetter to office manager\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\nWaseem\\n5 years 11 months\\nDear Mr Richard,\\nWe have received several complaints from our business partners and customers regarding the incompetence of the reception department. I am writing this letter to share some recommendations based on my personal experience.\\nFirstly, language is a barrier. Most of our visitors are from western countries and they speak only English. In our reception department, we lack staff who can speak fluent English, even if they do speak English, it is difficult for them to guide visitors. Secondly, they are not well-trained receptionists. They don''t have expertise in communication despite having necessary degrees.\\nSome of our visitors can be our potential business partners in future. Reception is the area where they get the first impression of our organization. Dealing with the visitors professionally where they arrive can help us avoid any sort of visitor’s inconvenience.\\nWe need someone at reception with having expertise in linguistics and communication. Staff with better interpersonal skills should be preferred.\\nThank you for giving the matter your attention and hope to hear your reply soon.\\nYours sincerely,\\nWaseem Khan\\nReply\\nQuote\\nSumeet\\n6 years 10 months\\nDear Mr Morgan,\\nI am writing this letter to offer my suggestions in order to overcome the issues and concerns lodged by the visitors regarding our reception area. The complaints have been raised typically about the sitting area near the main entrance.\\nThe reception area portrays our initial impression to our guests which enables them to develop a sense of professionalism of our company. However, these constant complaints have triggered an alarming situation for us to tackle.\\nI would like to suggest a few possible solutions to these concerns. First, we should instantly remove all the bins placed extremely close to the visitors'' chairs as they are the primary cause of the bad odour. They also make the place obnoxious and less healthy. Secondarily, we should train our receptionist to attend our incoming guests proactively.\\nAlso, kindly let me know if I could be of any help in this regard.\\nYours sincerely,\\nSumeet Jaggi\\nReply\\nQuote\\n×\\nReport\\nReport\\nClose"]'::jsonb,
