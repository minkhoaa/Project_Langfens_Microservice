  E'["Dear Mr Andrew,\\nI am Alfred Ton, a member of the ''Trinity'' music band, writing to express my grave concern about the letter we received from the community hall authority last Friday. I am hoping that you would allow us to continue our practice at a convent time you feel suitable for the greater good.\\nThe letter simply stated that we no longer can practise in the community hall and better look for an alternative. The scenario is, in fact, complicated than that. As a young group of musicians, we patronise the community and often perform without any royalty. We primarily focus on music and lyrics that promote peace, protest wars and inequity in society. A large number of followers, mostly youths, are encouraged by our work and they follow us on social media. We believe in our community and all the members of our band are sworn to work for a greater cause, not for money or fame. We often attend community welfare programmes and do voluntary social works as a team.\\nIf we are barred from using the community hall, we will soon find it hard to keep our dream alive as we are unable to hire an expensive location for practice. The purpose of the community hall is, in fact, to foster good works and support the community members, not to discourage them.\\nI, on behalf of my team, would like you to reconsider the decision as we believe in your vision for a better society. We can use the community hall on Friday and Saturday morning when according to my knowledge, no one uses it.\\nThanking you in advance.\\nYours faithfully,\\nAlfred Ton", "Dear Mr Ross,\\nHope you are doing excellent. I am writing this letter on behalf of “Omega Music Group” to let you know how sorry and disappointed we really are after learning that we will not be able to use the community hall for the purpose of practising music.\\nNot sure what exactly led you to take this decision, but we have been practising music on Monday and Wednesday evenings in this community hall for more than two years without any issue. By the way, we also try to help the young high school students in our community to learn different types of band music so that they can also become some expert musicians in future. We also try to organize musical concerts on different occasions in our city for free to raise funds for humanitarian causes, apart from attending community welfare programmes.\\nSo, as you can see, we are not causing any harm to the community, rather uplifting its spirit. Therefore, I would like to request you to reconsider your decision and allow us to keep practising on any other days, possibly on weekends, if Monday and Wednesday evenings are not convenient for you.\\nHope you will positively consider the situation.\\nYours sincerely,\\nTimothy Lee\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 4.59 (11 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nGT Writing Task 1\\nSemi-formal Letter\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\n×\\nReport\\nReport\\nClose"]'::jsonb,
