  E'["Dear Neha,\\nHope you''re doing great. I still miss my time with your children who are so adorable and amiable. I must say I had a great time with you last summer. Today I''m writing to ask you for a recipe that I''m planning to include in a party menu.\\nLast month I moved to a new apartment in Utica, a city in the Mohawk Valley, New York, and I have plans to invite some friends and neighbours to a party I''m thinking to hold in September. It''d be a dinner party and I''ll invite around 25 guests. Many of my friends are from India and I''m planning to add a special Indian food item.\\nI''m so fond of your Hyderabadi Biryani, you make it really special, and would like you to provide me with the recipe. I''ve tried it several times but never had a glimpse of the magnificent aroma and taste that you can bring to it. Would you please send me detailed instructions, ingredient list and cooking method you employ for the celestial Hyderabadi Biryani you make?\\nI want to give the Indian guests a fabulous experience of the dinner and invite some neighbours to taste it to give an impression of how Indian cuisines can win their stomach and heart!\\nWarm wishes,\\nRaima", "Dear Yuki,\\nHope you''re doing well. I''m writing this letter to ask for a favour from you. Actually, I need the recipe for Japanese Ramen Noodle Soup from you since I''m going to throw a party soon in which I want  to include this item.\\nOf course, this is going to be a very special party since all of my high school friends are going to get together and have a good time while talking about our work and achievements in life for the first time after finishing high school.\\nThe reason, for which, I''m asking for this recipe is that I fell in love with this particular soup after eating it at one of the upscale Japanese restaurants in my country. So, I thought that it just would be a great idea to introduce this awesome and delicious dish, instead of only those food items which we enjoy on a regular basis, to all of my friends at the party, so that I could impress them with my new idea.\\nPlease get back to me with the recipe for this incredible soup once you read this letter.\\nWarm wishes,\\nAdam\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 4.81 (8 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nGT Writing Task 1\\nInformal Letter\\nPersonal Letter\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\nRajeev Bajaj\\n3 years 6 months\\nHello.\\nReply\\nQuote\\n×\\nReport\\nReport\\nClose"]'::jsonb,
