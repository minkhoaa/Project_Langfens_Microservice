  E'["Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI am writing this letter to express my interest in a part-time job position as a team staff at your football club, which you advertised in a local newspaper a couple of days ago.\\nI was born and raised in this town, and I graduated from ACME university about a couple of years ago. Having graduated in Economics, I held one full-time job as an Assistant Manager at a local brokerage firm, and a part-time job at a restaurant. But unfortunately, none of these jobs really went well with my personality.\\nAnyway, I really enjoy football. In the past, as a university student, I was put in charge to co-ordinate inter-university tournaments. Besides, I have also taken a course in Nutrition and Personal Training certification which would allow me to offer some important nutritional and health tips to the footballers of your club. By the way, I have a very outgoing personality, and I can start as soon as you ask me to.\\nTherefore, based on my skills and credentials, I surely like to believe that I would be able to render excellent service to your club as a part-time staff.\\nYours faithfully,\\nNuwan Joshua\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 4.07 (15 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nGT Writing Task 1\\nFormal Letter\\nApplications\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\nAdesina Erioluwa\\n3 years 7 months\\nI love this blog.
