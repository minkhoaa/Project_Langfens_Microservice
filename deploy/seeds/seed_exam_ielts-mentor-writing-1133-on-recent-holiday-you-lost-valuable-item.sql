It was a gift from my father and holds immense sentimental value.\\nIn relation to the circumstances of the loss, I misplaced the watch while staying at the Grand Horizon Hotel in Barcelona on 12th February.

Despite reporting the matter to the hotel management and the local authorities, my efforts to recover it were unsuccessful.\\nGiven that my policy covers lost or stolen valuables, I would appreciate it if you could process my claim at the earliest opportunity.

Actually, I have lost my DSLR Camera during my Visit to Paris last week. I had brought the camera, embossed with LG logo on it, recently on this new year eve and it cost me an arm and a leg. Thus I got it insured for unfortunate circumstances like this. Allow me to elaborate on why I want this cause of action to be realized.My husband and I went to Paris for a fortnight, from 1st May to 15th, to celebrate our first marriage anniversary. Unfortunately, however, on the evening of 13th of May, while we were paying a visit to Effiel tower, a thief snatched the camera from my partner''s hand. We have reported the incident to the local cops and got a complaint registered but could not get the camera back. Hence, I want you to recover the loss.I trust you empathize with my plight and as per the insurance terms and condition, I can get 75% of the cost of the item lost within one month. I have attached the required documents.Please let me know if you need anything else.Yours faithfully,Meen akshi Arora\\nReply\\nQuote\\nVerna\\n7 years\\nI''m vеry pleased to fіnd this website.

Fortunately, you have travel insurance to cover the cost of anything lost.Write a letter to the manager of your insurance company.Answer:Dear Sir/ Madam,I am writing to inform you that during my last journey to the amazing Phuket Island which was covered by your travel insurance service, I’ve lost a set of scuba gear.Everything was great, ten successful dives were done, included night dives, deep dives, wreck dives and the last one was drift diving on our last day of the trip. It was just because of the lack of knowledge that I didn’t carry carabiners in order to attach my stuff. I would never have gone there with heavy equipment if I knew how the water flow could be enormous. It was in the boat where I first found out I had lost my Parachute, a pair of Fin, and my lovely non-manual Meridian dive computer.As a loyal customer to your insurance travel agency, I demand to receive the coverage of the all lost items as compensation. All items were fairly new and I had bought them right before I went on this trip. I would appreciate if you could take an immediate action about this case due to the fact that the next scuba diving season is really close and I need that money to buy new vital equipment.Yours truly,M. M. Akbary.\\nReply\\nQuote\\nJoyce Tan\\n8 years 11 months\\nDear Sir/Madam,\\nMy name is Joyce Tan, and I am one of your travel insurance clients. I am writing this letter to you to make a travel insurance claim for a lost item - a digital camera.\\nThe digital camera is from the Nikon brand and its model is A438. I purchased it in May 2021 and cost me RM 3899.00. Unfortunately, I have been pickpocketed during the time I was travelling to Hong Kong on 15th December 2021 for 5 days.\\nIt was an awful experience that I never had before. On the evening of 15 December 2016, I was taking an MRT train to my next destination during the peak hours, which was around 6.30 pm, and the train was almost full of passengers and very crowded. And I could not manage a seat, so I was standing in the crowd. My digital camera was still hanging on my left shoulder. Perhaps I was paying much attention to my station map while the pickpocket took place. When the train reached my station, I stepped out from it and headed toward my destination. I only then realized that my digital camera was no longer with me and the hanger got cut in between. Unluckily, I failed to catch the pickpocket on the spot. After this, I reported the incident to the nearest police station.\\nFor your kind information, I have purchased your company''s travel insurance for this Hong Kong trip. I hope you can read through the police report as enclosed and approve my claim insurance claim for the lost item. If you need any further information, please do not hesitate to contact or email me. My email address is joyce123@yahoo.com.\\nThank you in advance.\\nYours faithfully,\\nJoyce Tan\\nReply\\nQuote\\nJoyce Tan\\n9 years\\nDear Sir/Madam,\\nMy name is Joyce Tan, and I am one of your travel insurance clients.
