As you know, I was expecting a promotion, and last month our office administration promoted me to the Senior Manager position of their new branch in Denver. Therefore, I had to move to Denver which, in my opinion, is a great city to live in.\\nSituated in the South Platte River Valley, this modern city draws openness from the Great Plains to the east and features spectacular Rocky Mountain views to the west.

I haven’t heard from you in a while, and I think that it''s time for some exciting updates from my end. In fact, I''ve moved to a new city which is way better than my previous place.\\nThe new city is not as big as the previous one, but it''s not as crowded as my old city either. Besides, it''s a clean city, and it has lots of greeneries around. But, the best thing about the new city is that I actually get to live in a small and inexpensive apartment, which is very close to a beautiful lake.\\nAnyway, the main reason, for which, I have moved to a new city is that I got bored of living in the old city. Besides, the living expenses of the old city were skyrocketing every month as with every other big city. Another reason, for which, I moved to a new city is because it is actually closer to where my parents currently live. I''m sure you would like my new place, so come and visit me sometime!\\nWarm wishes,\\nHamid\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 3.12 (38 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nGT Writing Task 1\\nInformal Letter\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\nFayyaz\\n3 years\\nCan you write me an email about my day trip to a place in the countryside?\\nReply\\nQuote\\n×\\nReport\\nReport\\nClose"]'::jsonb,
