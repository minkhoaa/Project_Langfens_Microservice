  E'["Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI am writing in regards to the evening programmes which are currently being telecast on your TV channel. As per the current schedule of the evening slot, most of the programmes are dull and less exciting. It would be great if you can reschedule some of these programmes and introduce more exciting and absorbing programmes in the evening time.\\nMost of these programmes of the evening slot are in the category of soap opera and the target audiences are mostly adult women. If this slot had more family entertainment programmes like comedy, magic shows, reality shows, children-oriented programmes, or documentaries, it would have been more captivating for audiences of all ages. I believe by introducing this variety of programmes into the evening slot, your channel can attract more viewers as well as advertisers. Since audiences of a specific age group enjoy your evening programmes, you must be missing some advertising opportunities.\\nEvening time in each family is considered to be the reunion time. Children join their parents after completing a long day in school and in the same way parents also return home after a tiring day in the office. So every member of the family prefers being in the living room in the evening as their meeting place and the television is their medium for relaxation and entertainment. Now if your channel can telecast my proposed list of programmes, it will cover the interest of everyone in the family.\\nI hope my request is valid and logical enough to draw your attention. Please reconsider your current evening programmes which are being broadcast.\\nYours faithfully,\\nNilay Das\\n[", "Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI am a fan of your TV channel because of the quality of the programs and the excellent shows you broadcast most of the time. But, lately, some of the programs, which are being aired during the evening time, are becoming monotonous and sub-standard, to say the least. So, I thought that it was time for me to write this letter to you to request you to change some of the evening programs and introduce some exciting and absorbing programs instead.\\nBy the way, the TV programs, including some random cooking shows, talk shows and foreign language learning programs, in the evening are targeted at only certain groups of audiences, and they are not interesting for general viewers at all.\\nNow, while I do not have much of an issue watching such programs once in a while, I would be more interested to watch some famous comedy shows, documentaries on different kinds of wildlife, science fiction movies, and travel show also at the same time. I think that such diversities in your evening TV programs would prove out to be better since it would attract many more audiences for your TV channel while also generating more advertising revenues.\\nI hope you will consider my suggestions and bring out some changes to your evening programs.\\nYours faithfully,\\nRobinson Duke\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 4.50 (14 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nGT Writing Task 1\\nFormal Letter\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\nGill Sir\\n7 years 2 months\\nIELTS is a very important test and it is useful that you provide us with the hints to do preparation for it. Thanks a lot.\\nReply\\nQuote\\nFarid\\n8 years 9 months\\nI think the first sample is off topic because, in question 2, you should give your personal view beside the general statements.\\nReply\\nQuote\\nAnirban\\n8 years 10 months\\nDear Sir,I am writing this letter to express my disliking towards the dull evening programs that are broadcasted on SITI cable network from 5.00 pm to 7.30 pm every day.The programmes which are broadcasted during the evening time are mainly soap operas where the stories are almost similar in every respect. The main storyline includes conflicts between family members, especially between ladies, and also teaches various lessons that can reduce the harmony in an average family in our country. Moreover, this spreads a sense of negativity which is the reason I would like you to replace those soap operas with some interesting programmes that children (who are usually at home during that time) can watch.It would be really great if you start broadcasting some of the documentaries on the life of our most famous freedom fighters and their struggles in freeing this country from British Rule or Space Exploration documentaries. These documentaries will help everyone to know how much struggle the freedom fighters had to do in order to get independence. Space Exploration Documentaries will also help everyone to know more about our galaxy and more about our universe.I am looking forward to seeing the changes and your kind consideration to make your TV channel more popular and helpful to people.Yours Faithfully,Anir ban\\nReply\\nQuote\\nMila\\n9 years\\n''broadcast'' is irregular, ''re-think'' here - informal, and many more grammar, vocabulary and register mistakes.\\nReply\\nQuote\\nPunnu\\n9 years 3 months\\nExceed word limit.\\nReply\\nQuote\\n×\\nReport\\nReport\\nClose"]'::jsonb,
