I am hoping that you will assist me in finding those documents as soon as possible.\\nI attended a business meeting in the Maple Conference Room on the second floor of your hotel from 3:00 PM to 6:00 PM. I believe I may have left my folder containing the documents on the table near the projector when we wrapped up the session. The folder is black with a silver clip, and it contains several printed reports and handwritten notes.\\nThe issue with these documents is that they contain confidential business information related to an upcoming corporate project. Losing them could cause significant inconvenience for my team, as we have a presentation scheduled next week based on those reports.\\nI would appreciate it if you could check the conference room and your lost-and-found department for the folder. If it has been found, I would be grateful if you could either hold onto it until I collect it or arrange for it to be sent to my office.\\nPlease let me know at your earliest convenience. I look forward to your prompt response.\\nYours faithfully,\\nWilliam Scott", "Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI am writing this letter to inform you that I have left some important papers when I checked out of your hotel about a couple of days ago. I am hoping that you would be kind enough to send those papers to my address via the postal service.\\nI am Lucas Foster, and I stayed in room number 434 on the sixth floor of your hotel. I am assuming that I must have left the papers in one of the drawers of your TV desk in a hurry when I needed to attend an urgent meeting with some of my clients in the City Hall.\\nThe documents that I left in your hotel room are utterly important because they contain all the important terms and conditions, which I agreed upon with two of our new partners to form a new business relationship. The problem is, I can not really remember all those terms and conditions, so I need to get those documents back urgently.\\nTherefore, I would like to request you to find those documents for me and mail them to me at your earliest convenience. Also, please do not forget to charge the mailing cost from my credit card that you already have on file.\\nYours faithfully,\\nLucas Foster\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 3.90 (20 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nGT Writing Task 1\\nFormal Letter\\nLetter Writing Sample\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\nVed Sudesh\\n4 years 8 months\\nYou recently attended a meeting at a hotel.

I stayed in room number 1604 and checked out on the 4th of March. Due to a tight schedule and hurry to catch the flight early in the morning, I left some important legal documents in the room where I stayed. As best as I can recollect my memory, I left them next on the bedside drawer in the room.\\nThe papers that I have left include some vital documents about our organization and details about the future expansion and projection. On top of that, it also has the original copy of the presentation which I had prepared in the last 6 months. Misplacing them could be a setback for me and consequently, I may get a dismissal because of negligence. I am hoping and praying that the above-mentioned property has been found and kept with you in the Lost and Found Section in your reputed hotel.\\nPlease note that my cell phone number is 7738190437, and I am available 24 hours a day.
