  E'["Dear Mr Victor,\\nI am excited to be a participant in the environment and disaster management training programme that you are organising next month in London. I have always wanted to enhance my skills on that, and this is an excellent opportunity for me to do so. I noticed from a follow-up email that you are looking for volunteers for a social event, and I would like to take part in this volunteer position.\\nI have been involved in many voluntary works since my college days and have extensive experience in organising such events. In my office, I am often responsible to plan important events, coordinate with the event management team, facilitate the guest lecturers and ensure conducting successful meetings. I enjoy playing such roles and I am quite confident I would be the right person for your social event as well.\\nI would, therefore, request you to send me more details regarding the training session and your plan for it so that I can start contributing right away. My participant ID is SEL-087 and you can check my profile before selecting me as an organiser.\\nI am looking forward to hearing from you soon. Thanks in advance.\\nYours sincerely,\\nDavid Frank", "Dear Mr Reynold,\\nI would like to thank you for allowing me to join the month-long training programme that you will be organising. Anyway, I am writing this letter to express my interest to become the social events’ organizer on how to show cultural sensitivity at work as one of the participants in your training programme.\\nIn the past, I have volunteered in different social events like organizing a picnic for a huge number of students at my junior college, throwing a welcome party for my company boss after closing a very successful business deal abroad, and organizing a Christmas party for the local community members in my area. I have even helped organize a fundraising event for a local political campaign in my town.\\nSo, it is fair to suggest that I do know a few things about organizing social events. By the way, I would like to get some additional information on the events, such as what kinds of guests are expected at the events and how large would be the gathering. I will await your response.\\nYours sincerely,\\nPaul Nigel\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 4.93 (7 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nSemi-formal Letter\\nRequesting-information-letter\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\nMaria\\n3 years 4 months\\nYou are going on to a month-long training programme in the UK and know that the head of the course would like one of the participants to be the social events’ organiser.\\nSample Letter Answer:\\nDear Mr Arnold,\\nI am Maria Maqbool, and I have recently enrolled in the training programme for the clothes exhibition that you are going to organise in the UK.
