  E'["Dear Mrs Barrett,\\nMy name is Elaine Sully, and I am writing this letter to make an enquiry if you still need somebody to help you at your home. Actually, very recently I have come across your advertisement in a local newspaper, and I just thought that it would be a great opportunity for me to earn some extra cash to take a piano lesson during the next summer while also helping you at your home.\\nWith regards to what sort of assistance I could offer you, I could do anything from washing dishes to doing and folding laundry. I can even do grocery shopping once in a while, in addition to preparing some occasional afternoon snacks. And I have learnt to do all these things right at my home because I have to fill in for the duties of my mother, who has to leave the house every once in a while for professional reasons.\\nBy the way, I am available anytime during the weekends from 7:00 am to 11:00 pm and from 4:00 pm to 9:00 pm during the weekdays except on Tuesdays. So, if this fits your need, please let me know.\\nYours faithfully,\\nElaine Sully", "Dear Mrs Barrett,\\nI recently came across your advertisement regarding your need for help in your home for a few hours a day next summer, and I would love to offer my assistance.\\nI could help you with a range of household tasks, such as cleaning, organising, preparing light meals, and running errands. If you have a garden, I would also be happy to assist with watering plants and general upkeep. Additionally, if you need any administrative tasks done, such as sorting paperwork or managing appointments, I am comfortable with that as well.\\nI would like to take up this opportunity because I enjoy helping others, and I believe it would be a rewarding experience. Furthermore, I am looking for temporary work during the summer, and this role fits well with my schedule.\\nI will be available from June to August, every morning until early afternoon. However, I will be unavailable on weekends due to prior commitments. Please let me know if my availability aligns with your requirements.\\nI look forward to hearing from you.\\nYours sincerely,\\nAlia Gomez", "Dear Mrs Barrett,\\nI am Lia Lima, a university student and a local in the neighbourhood, writing to you to show my interest in helping you with your household work next summer.\\nI can help you with cleaning the kitchen, cooking a few items, taking the garbage outside and doing groceries. I can also iron your clothes, clean your floor with a vacuum cleaner and call the pharmacy to refill the medicine.\\nI will have a long holiday this summer, and I will take a part-time computer course. It means that I will have a few hours each day to spare to work at your home while also earning some money to support the expenses of the part-time computer course that I am planning to intake.\\nI will be available between 9:00 am and 1:00 pm each day except Sunday. I would also be busy on Tuesdays as I visit my mother and take a dance class every Tuesday.\\nI am looking forward to assisting you with your work this summer and getting to know you better. For your convenience, I am attaching my details with this letter.\\nYours faithfully,\\nLia Lima\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 3.89 (18 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nGT Writing Task 1\\nLetter Writing Sample\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\n×\\nReport\\nReport\\nClose"]'::jsonb,
