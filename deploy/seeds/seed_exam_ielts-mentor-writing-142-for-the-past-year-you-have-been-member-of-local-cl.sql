  E'["Dear Mr Martin,\\nI have been an exultant member of your club for about 1 year. I first enrolled as a member in 2023, and the next year my membership was upgraded to Silver Associate with a monthly fee of $50, paid every first Monday of the month. I regret to inform you that I can no longer continue my membership in the club as I will relocate to a different city soon.\\nThis club has given me numerous benefits by providing activities, such as yoga classes that I am really fond of, as well as access to the gymnasium and swimming pool. Not to mention that there are always generous discounts on the food in the buffet restaurant. I have truly enjoyed my access to the library that helped me read many books.\\nSadly, given my circumstances, I would have to discontinue my membership at this club. The reason is that I will soon be moving to another city. Thus, I would no longer be able to attend any activities held in this place. If I am not mistaken, my $250 deposit will be returned to me upon membership cancellation. Please advise should there be any particular form that I need to fill in.\\nThank you. I look forward to hearing from you.\\nYours sincerely,\\nHelen Kelly\\n[", "Dear Mrs Watson,\\nI regret to inform you that I can no longer maintain my classic membership with your club from next month onwards.

I would request you to cancel my membership from next month.\\nI paid my monthly membership fee online and it was £35 per month. The attached documents show my last six months'' transactions to the club and all my transactions are paid in time.\\nThis club is indeed a blessing to our locality as the community members did not have enough recreational facilities and just had a jogging track without any proper marking. But with the emergence of this distinguished club, they were benefitted profoundly. I personally gained from it enormously - I made some good friends, learned the rules of various games, took part in outdoor activities and last but not least, learned valuable skills.\\nWith a heavy heart and immense regret, I am discontinuing my bond with this club due to my recent job transfer to the USA. I have no words to fill my sorrow over this decision, but I feel this is just the softest way to communicate my decision.\\nSincerely yours,\\nAndrew Scott\\n[", "Dear Mr Brooke,\\nI regret to inform you that I have to discontinue my level 2 membership at your Golden Hook Fishing Club. I joined the Club a year ago and the benefits of the participation well exceeded the membership fee. I am hoping that you would help me finish the official procedure to cancel my membership.\\nI received numerous benefits from the club as a level 2 member. The roundtables and lectures of famous fishermen were absolutely brilliant. Moreover, discounts on the equipment in sports gear shops was a money saver.

I must acknowledge that continuing the membership of your Club is no longer an option for me as I will be leaving London soon.\\nI have paid my monthly fee using my credit card and its details could be found in your database.
