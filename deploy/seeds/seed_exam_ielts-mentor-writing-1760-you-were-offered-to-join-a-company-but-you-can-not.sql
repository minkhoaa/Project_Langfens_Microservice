  E'["Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI would like to thank you for the opportunity to join your company. Regrettably, due to the prevailing situation in my present organisation, I cannot accept the offer right now. However, I am hoping to be a part of your company in the future.\\nIn my present organisation, I have recently been given a chance to manage an important long-term project and I think this is the right time to portray my capabilities to the company. It not only paves over my organisational development but also for my personal growth. At this juncture, bidding adieu to my present employer is not the right decision and I once again express my heartfelt gratitude for the belief you have in me and for giving me the offer. However, my current employer has recently requested me to carry on with them and I am grateful to them for the growth opportunity they have given me so far. I like the way this company manages big clients and the healthy work environment they offer.\\nPlease do consider my humble request and I am extremely sorry for declining the job offer. However, I would like to work with you in the coming days and I am hoping that you would consider me a potential employee sometime in the future.\\nYours faithfully,\\nPrasadarao Talluri\\n(", "Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI am writing in response to the offer letter, you on behalf of the  DesignCrowd, have mailed me recently. I would like to thank you for the chance to join your company as a System Analyst. Unfortunately, I am unable to accept the offer right now and would like you to consider me in the future.\\nBefore citing my reasons for not accepting the offer, I would first like to thank you for giving me such a great opportunity.  Due to my personal commitment to my current employer, I cannot accept your offer. Kindly note that I joined my current employer a year ago and when I informed them that I am planning to leave, my manager arranged a face-to-face meeting and convinced me to continue with them for at least another year. I love the way this company treats its employee on top of the performance appraisal and a healthy work environment.\\nThus, considering his faith in me, it would be too early to change the job. I hope you will understand my reasons for continuing my current job, and please allow me to remain in your good books.\\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\\nYours faithfully,\\nRia Nagpal\\n("]'::jsonb,
