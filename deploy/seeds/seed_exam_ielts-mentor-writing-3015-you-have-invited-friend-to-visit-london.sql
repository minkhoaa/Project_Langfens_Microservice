  E'["Dear Amrita,\\nHope you and your parents are doing great. I am writing to affirm that I would be highly delighted to host you as a guest at our house for one to three months. I reaffirm that you are invited to stay in our large 5-bedroom house and dine with us during your stay. I own this house which is located in central London and have two spare rooms. I have already made plans to visit the main attractions in London and cannot wait to see you.\\nI will receive you at the airport and while you are in London, I will take care of the expenses. I work for a local fashion house as a senior manager and my yearly salary is more than 120 thousand Pounds. My husband is a doctor and he earns significantly higher than I do. So you do not need to worry about any expense at all. You are a family member to me, not just a friend, and I am looking forward to having some quality time with you here in London. I hereby enclose my last six months’ bank statement and last year’s tax papers as references, in case you need those to submit to the embassy.\\nDo not take long to visit us.\\nWith loves and warm wishes,\\nAnika", "Dear Antonio,\\nIt was so exciting to read your letter, especially your adventure in a distant village in Italy which I would never dare to attempt. However, I am writing today to assert that I will be happy to host you at my house during your visit to the UK.\\nAs I have already stated in one of my previous letters to you, I am eagerly waiting for your arrival in London. I already have many plans and I cannot wait to receive you at the airport. I am a software engineer in a large company in London and my wife is a lecturer at a college. We are financially solvent and own a large apartment in the city centre. We have two spare rooms that can accommodate 2-3 guests and are currently vacant.\\nI have not met you for more than 5 years and this was mostly because of your tight schedule. I wish our time together in London would take back us to our college days which were magical. I wonder how time does fly!\\nDo hurry to meet me as I cannot wait any longer to have you with us.\\nWarm wishes,\\nSazal\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 4.88 (8 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nInformal Letter\\nPersonal Letter\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\nRajesh\\n8 years\\nIt was a nice and a productive letter.\\nReply\\nQuote\\n×\\nReport\\nReport\\nClose"]'::jsonb,
