  E'You should spend about\n20\nminutes on this task.\nYou use trains to reach the office but the timetable of the train has been changed recently. Also, the train you take to work no longer stops at your station. Write a letter to the railway authority about it.\nIn your letter,\nintroduce yourself\nwhat problems have been created due to the changes\nwhat you would suggest them to do\nYou should write at least\n150\nwords.\nYou do\nNOT\nneed to write any addresses.\nBegin your letter as follows:\nDear Sir or Madam\n,\nModel\nAnswer 1:\nDear Sir or Madam,\nI would like to draw your kind attention that, the train schedule in my area has recently been changed and due to this, many office goers like me are suffering. I am hoping you would keep the previous timetable and introduce more frequent trains for the convenience of the residents.\nI am a banker and I work as an assistant manager at the City Bank. I regularly commute to my office using your train. Sadly, the train I used to take to reach office no longer stops at our station and as a result, we need to travel a few extra miles to reach the City Centre Station which is overcrowded in the morning hours. I am often late to reach my office and have objections about the revised train timetable.\nWith the introduction of the new train schedule, daily commuting for employees like me has become utterly difficult which ultimately makes your service unreliable. Unfortunately, because of this problem, many commuters are late for their work which is affecting their productivity. Consequently, they are very upset about your service.\nAs a solution to this problem, I would recommend you to revert to the previous schedule and arrange more trains during the peak hours. If it is not possible, then at least add more carriages to increase the space. It will be a great relief if you can resolve this problem as soon as possible.\nThank you for giving the matter your attention and I hope to hear your reply soon.\nYours faithfully,\nCampbell Scott',

  E'["Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI am a resident of the Seven Hills area and I regularly use your trains to commute to and from my office. The recent change to the train schedule is causing great suffering for many commuters like me and I am hoping you would consider a revision of the timetable.\\nI work for an IT company in Denver and several other office goers have the same schedule that I follow to reach the workplace. I used to take one of your trains at 7:40 AM from Seven Hills Station and usually reached my destination around 8:30 in the morning. The Denver Station, where the train used to drop me off, is only five minutes walk from my office.\\nHowever, under the revised timetable, your train no longer stops at my station at 7:40 AM and I am forced to take a train from the Curberry Station at 8:30 am which is almost a mile away from my residence. This revised timetable and schedule are inconvenient for us. A train takes passengers from our station, but only at 6.30 in the morning and this is too early for us to get on the train. I have also checked with fellow passengers who are also struggling to get to work on time.\\nI request you revise the train timing again and reinstate 7:40 AM''s train to stop at our station, which will enable me or fellow passengers to travel to work on time.\\nThank you for giving the matter your attention and I hope to hear your reply soon.\\nYours faithfully\\nRavi Babu\\n[ by - Ravi Babu ]\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 4.95 (10 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nGT Writing Task 1\\nFormal Letter\\nComplaints-letter\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\nVijay Kumar\\n2 years 11 months\\nDear Sir or Madam,\\nI am a resident of Kolar, and writing this letter to bring to your attention that we no longer have a scheduled train from our station that used to come and leave every day. We have more than twenty thousand residents in our area and not a single train which I believe is really inconvenient for us now. I hope you would take the initiatives to solve this issue.\\nI would respectfully like to inform you that the trains 06396, 06551, 06561, 06389, 06529, 16526 and 01771 run daily from Bangarpet to KSR Bangalore, but there is no train facility from Kolar anymore. For the last month, the train that used to stop at our station no longer does so due to a changing schedule. It is causing us a big problem every day.\\nSo, please rethink the train time schedule and please consider our suffering due to this. I hope you would be kind enough to consider the situation and take steps so that we get at least one train at our station daily.\\nYours faithfully,\\nVijay Kumar.\\nReply\\nQuote\\nPreetika\\n7 years 10 months\\nThanks for posting. It is very beneficial for me. Can you please email me general reading test for practice? I really need that. Thanking you - Preetika.\\nReply\\nQuote\\n×\\nReport\\nReport\\nClose"]'::jsonb,
