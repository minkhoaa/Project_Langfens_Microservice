  E'["Dear Neha,\\nI hope you are healthy and happy. What about the result of your M.B.A course? I am glad to tell you that I have got a distinction in my M.Sc. course and would like you to be present at a party I am throwing to commemorate the event on 25th August.\\nI am planning for a small party at my home this coming Sunday, 25th August. I would like to invite you to the party and I really want to see you on that day. I have invited all our childhood friends, hence it would be a get-together party for all of us. This party will definitely be a good reason to meet.\\nLast year I moved into a new apartment which is in the Satellite area of the city and I hope you have my address. It is very easy to find my residence. First, you should reach the Satellite area, main road and towards the left of the entrance, you will find a shopping mall called KH 24; from there you should come straight away and you will find my apartment. I have sent you my coordinates at Google Maps in your email.\\nHowever, if you have any difficulty in finding my address, just call me. I will send my cousin for your help. See you at the party then.\\nBest wishes,\\nRahul\\n[", "Dear Daniel,\\nHow are you doing these days? I know, I haven’t talked to you in a while, but that’s because I have been so busy with my work and other things lately. Anyway, I am writing this letter to invite you to attend a party.\\nWith regard to the party, I''ve decided to throw that party on the occasion of moving into a newly-built home. Apparently, we are so happy to be able to finally move into our new home, and I want to share our happiness with friends, families and relatives. That is why I am throwing this party which will take place on 19th February. The party will include a cake-cutting ceremony and a dinner party. But, before the dinner is served, a few video clips on how the house was built gradually will also be displayed. After dinner, we will enjoy a music concert.\\nHere is the direction of our new house from your town - first take the N-35 highway, drive about 2 hours towards the north and reach our city. After that, take right on “Harmony” road and drive about 2 kilometres before you see a large shopping centre named “Valeria”. The house is right behind the shopping centre.\\nI hope to see you at the party.\\nWarm wishes,\\nStefan Hermann\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 3.60 (34 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nInformal Letter\\nPersonal Letter\\nInvitation-letter\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\nNaman Arora\\n4 years 3 months\\nDearest Matty,\\nI hope you and your family are safe and in great spirits. I’m missing you so much. I’m writing to invite you to a get-together party at my place on Sunday, the 5th of February.\\nYou may wonder how did this plan originate! Well, a couple of days ago, I came to know that one of my cousins organised a similar event for her school friends and they had a blast. This made me think why I can''t arrange something like this, especially as we haven’t met for a couple of years.\\nTherefore, I''ve decided to have this party for all our classmates. I have invited the entire class of section \\"E\\" from our high school! I have spoken to all of them on the phone, and almost everyone has said \\"yes\\". It is going to be epic, so you cannot miss it!\\nThe programme is at 8:00 PM at my residence, 55 MG Road, New Delhi. It is a bungalow near the freedom statue on MG Road.\\nDo RSVP to me by Thursday, please.\\nHoping to see you soon,\\nYours truly,\\nNandini\\nReply\\nQuote\\nNadia\\n4 years 5 months\\nDear Soma,\\nI hope you are happy and safe during this unprecedented time of pandemics and lockdown. You would be glad to hear that I''ve recently been hired by a large multinational company. I''ll start my work with them at their Singapore office from next November. Since I''ll leave for Singapore before November, when hopefully the lockdown will be lifted, I''m throwing a small party to meet you guys on 17th October.\\nIt''ll be a small party, and I''ll meet you guys at my home. I would very much like you to be present at the party. I''ve already invited some of our high school and college friends to the party. So, I''m hoping that it''d be a nice party for all of us where we will talk to each other, and enjoy some homemade food and drinks at the same time. I''m looking forward to enjoying it with you guys.\\nAs far as I recall, you have been to my new house twice, and I''m guessing you won''t face any problem locating it. Nevertheless, just to refresh your mind, you should reach the Bay Marine area, and then walk for 5-6 minutes towards the bay drive. You will find the Blooming Flower school there, and if you turn right and walk for another 3-4 minutes, my house is at the end of it.\\nDon''t hesitate to call me if you face any difficulty in finding my address. I will send someone to fetch you up. Hope to see you at the party.\\nWarm wishes,\\nNadia\\nReply\\nQuote\\nBilal\\n6 years 1 month\\nDear Shan,\\nI''m writing to invite you to the birthday celebration of my son on the first Friday of next month. It''s a great moment of joy and happiness that I want to share. This will give you a moment to get out of your town and suffice all your previous complaints of me having shared no fun moments with you in a while.\\nThat would be a great occasion for my friends and family to be in one place after a really long time. Our common friends from the college are also expected to join. This is going to be a good opportunity for all of us to revive our memories. Guess what? Atif is also coming in to sing live and make things more exciting.\\nEver since I moved to Lahore, we haven''t been together. So it''d be your first time and you''d definitely need directions to my place. If you''d be travelling by air, it''d be much more suitable for me to pick you up since I live close by. The bus station is approximately 10 km away from my place. Once you arrive at the local station in Lahore, you''d need to catch the only metro from the southern terminal and must drop at the last stop that is right in front of my house.\\nI can''t wait to see you.\\nYour friend,\\nBilal\\nReply\\nQuote\\nRaman\\n7 years 9 months\\nWrite a letter to your friend who lives in another town and invite him/her to a party you are going to organise.In your letter explain: - why are you having this party - who are expected to be present at the party - give directions how to get there.You should write at least 150 words. Letter Answer: Dear Sam,I am so delighted to announce that I am having a party on 20th March and would like you to be present in my apartment in the evening. I am sure we will have a great time together.It''s been a long time since we last met. You would be happy to hear that I have recently been promoted to the senior executive position in my office and I have decided to throw a party whenever I get a time. Finally, I picked 20th March as the suitable date. I have invited many of our common friends and a few colleagues from my workplace. I am looking forward to having fun together.I changed my apartment around six months ago and the new address is \\"Apartment 4B, Lane: 34, Colombus Pier street\\", Downtown, Dalton. Two prominent landmarks around my location are the city museum and Madame clock tower. You can use the Google Map to locate the address or ask a taxi driver. Just give me a call if you have trouble locating my apartment. I will send one of cousins or friends to fetch you to my apartment. Do not miss the party as I am so much looking forward to having you. Best wishes,Divya\\nReply\\nQuote\\nSita\\n7 years 9 months\\nDearest Rohan and Megha,Hope you are doing great. I am writing this letter to invite you both to a small dinner party at my place on 3rd March. I am really looking forward to spending some quality time with you. I am excited to let you know that I have been promoted to Assistant Manager and this took me 3 years to achieve. I was really expecting to get promoted and this is one of the mentionable achievements in my professional life. So I would love to have a get-together party to celebrate it but not without you guys. Only a few relatives and close friends are invited. However, I intend to invite some of our university friends and their families, so that, after a long, we could meet everyone.I think you already know the address of my new residence. The address is ''Flat# 21-B, Park Street, Southampton.'' I would love to have you and your family present at the party and have a great time together. See you soon,Sita.\\nReply\\nQuote\\n×\\nReport\\nReport\\nClose"]'::jsonb,
