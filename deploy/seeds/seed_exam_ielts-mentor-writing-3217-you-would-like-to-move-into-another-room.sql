  E'["Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI am writing to request you to change my current accommodation arrangement in our college hostel, and let me move into another room which is favourable for studies and pleasant to live in.\\nI am Erica Garcia, a science major student in your college, and I reside in the college hostel in room F-412. I find it very challenging to live and study in this room. First of all, the room is quite small to accommodate two students. Two beds and other necessary furniture in this room leave no open space, and we hardly get space to walk or move in this room. Because of that, we were hurt several times by the sharp corners of the iron beds. The lack of proper ventilation facilities, and the scarcity of natural sunlight and fresh air are two big issues with this room. We are bound to use the electric light 24 hours a day. It is quite suffocating, and because of this, I can not concentrate on my studies.\\nTherefore, I humbly request you to allow me any other room where at least a proper ventilation facility is present. I am hoping that you would let me move into another room, preferably a large one, before my semester final in October.\\nI am looking forward to your positive response.\\nYours faithfully,\\nErica Garcia", "Dear Sir or Madam,\\nMy name is Aaron Johnson, and I have been living at one of the Trinity college hostels for almost 6 months. My room number is 241, and I share it with another student. Regrettably, I am writing this letter to inform you about some of the severe problems that I have been dealing with for the last six months.\\nFirst of all, this room is too small for 2 students. In fact, after setting there two single beds and two study tables, there is hardly any extra space left in the room. Besides, the walls of the room on all sides remain dampened most of the time, spreading some kind of bad odour, which is certainly not good for our health. In fact, because of this continuous foul odour, sometimes we cough. Finally, the attached bathroom very seldom releases hot water, and as a result, we have to take a shower in cold water which makes us sick, during the winter.\\nTherefore, I would really appreciate it if you please transfer us to another room which is remodelled or built new and has a hot water supply in its attached bathroom.\\nYours faithfully,\\nAaron Johnson\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 4.46 (12 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nGT Writing Task 1\\nFormal Letter\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\n×\\nReport\\nReport\\nClose"]'::jsonb,
