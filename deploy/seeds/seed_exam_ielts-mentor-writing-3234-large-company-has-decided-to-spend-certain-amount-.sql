  E'You should spend about\n20\nminutes on this task.\nA large company in your area has decided to spend a certain amount of money, either to sponsor a local children’s sports team for two years, or to pay for two open-air concerts.

I deeply appreciate your readiness to sponsor a local junior sports team or alternatively arrange two open-air concerts.\nNeedless to say, financial support to a children''s sports team will be notably advantageous for both the team and your business. With your sponsorship, they will surely get advanced training which will develop their potential in sports, and in parallel, promote your brand.

  E'["Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI would like to profoundly thank your organisation for the decision to spend money for the benefit of our community. I deeply appreciate your readiness to sponsor a local junior sports team or alternatively arrange two open-air concerts.\\nNeedless to say, financial support to a children''s sports team will be notably advantageous for both the team and your business.

Concerts would be temporary entertainments for the local people, but provision for the young sportsmen will be remembered for a long and would give us many occasions to celebrate and be proud of.\\nOnce again thank you for a commendable initiative.\\nYours faithfully,\\nEdward Jenkins", "Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI am writing to convey my opinion regarding your generous initiative to invest in the local community, either by sponsoring a children’s sports team for two years or by funding two open-air concerts. Both options would bring great value to our area, but I believe that sponsoring the sports team would have a more lasting impact.\\nSupporting a children’s sports team would promote physical activity, teamwork, and discipline among young people. Regular training and participation in competitions would boost their confidence and encourage a healthy lifestyle. Moreover, long-term sponsorship would ensure financial stability, allowing the team to purchase proper equipment, hire skilled coaches, and compete at higher levels.\\nOn the other hand, open-air concerts would provide entertainment for a wide audience, bringing people together and enriching the cultural life of our community. Such events could attract visitors from neighbouring areas, benefiting local businesses. However, their impact would be temporary.\\nConsidering the long-term advantages, I strongly recommend that the company invest in the children’s sports team, as this would provide ongoing benefits for young people and the broader community.\\nYours faithfully,\\nBlake Harrison", "Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI would like to express my appreciation for your decision to spend money for the benefit of our community - either to sponsor a local juvenile sports team or to arrange two concerts.\\nUndeniably, your support for the local junior sports team for two years would ensure better training and equipment for the young and aspiring athletes which in turn would bring success and fame to our community. Your sponsorship for them would not only attract more sponsors in the future but also ensure that they become successful athletes in the future. Consequently, more children would be interested to be in sports.\\nOn the other hand, if you sponsor two open-air concerts, it would excite people to enjoy the events. Besides, it would advertise your brand and set a milestone for others to arrange such engaging events. Many local bands would get an opportunity to perform and show their talent, and thus become known to many people.\\nThough both initiatives would be highly appreciated by the local people, I believe paying for the concert would be a far better idea, especially at a time when people are having less frequent chances to gather and enjoy themselves together.\\nI would like to thank you again for your great decision and your willingness to support the community.\\nYours faithfully,\\nGeorge Adamson\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 4.65 (13 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nGT Writing Task 1\\nFormal Letter\\nLetter Writing Sample\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\nShahil Nisha\\n4 years 8 months\\nA large company in your area has decided to spend a certain amount of money, either to sponsor a local children’s sports team for two years or to pay for two open-air concerts. It has asked for feedback from the general public.\\nWrite a letter to the company.\\nMy answer:\\nDear Sir or Madam,\\nI am writing this letter to give feedback on your initiative to either sponsor our local sports team for children or to arrange two outdoor concerts. Both are good for our community, and I hope my feedback would be useful to you.\\nTo begin with, sponsoring the children''s sports team for two years has various advantages. It will motivate young players in our community to a great extent to do well in various local and international sports events. It will motivate many young children to get involved in different sports who are not already in it while also help renovate the sports centres that we have.\\nOn the other hand, live concerts have some benefits as well. It will encourage many youngsters to engage in music and cultural activities while also offer some pure entertainment to the people in our community as they enjoy such programmes to a great extent.\\nHowever, in my opinion, you should utilize your money to sponsor the children''s sports team as it has greater benefits for the community. I think it will promote your brand more effectively as well.\\nI hope you will consider my suggestions. Thank you again for the great initiative.\\nYours faithfully,\\nShahil Nisha\\nReply\\nQuote\\nThomas\\n6 years 3 months\\nDear Sir/Madam,\\nThis is with reference to your company''s advertisement in a local newspaper inviting feedback on the decision to either sponsor the children’s sports team or a concert as part of the corporate social responsibility program. I am very happy for your firm''s decision to support the local community.\\nOur children''s cricket team is probably one of the best teams in this province. Despite the lack of proper facilities, it has been consistently winning the tournaments since the past two years, and they had recently won the Zonal Level Cup. This team badly needs a professional trainer and upgrade their sports kits. If this team gets a good sponsor, they can have a higher chance to win the next year''s national cup.\\nOn the other hand, sponsoring for an open-air concert is a nice idea as this will increase the tourism of this area. Moreover, the local talents may get motivated because of the event, and they may get a good opportunity to showcase their talent.\\nIn my opinion, it is far better to sponsor our kids’ cricket team as they are the assets of this area. They can increase the fame of locality and sponsors if properly groomed.\\nThank you for allotting your valuable time to read this letter. I am waiting for a positive reply.\\nYours faithfully,\\nThomas Terry\\nReply\\nQuote\\nFazeeIsmail\\n6 years 4 months\\nYou are doing a great service for the betterment of students’ academic activities.\\nReply\\nQuote\\n×\\nReport\\nReport\\nClose"]'::jsonb,
