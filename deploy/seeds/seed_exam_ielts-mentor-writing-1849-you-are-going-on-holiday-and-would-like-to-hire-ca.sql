  E'["Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI am planning to organise a trip for my family to Manali during the upcoming summer holiday and for this, I want to hire a four-wheeler. I am writing to inquire about the availability of an eight-seater SUV within the time period of 5th to 10th November 2025.\\nFirst, I would like to inform you that my grandfather is in a wheelchair and he is also escorting us on the trip. Hence the vehicle should be spacious enough as the comfort of the passengers is the foremost consideration for us. Moreover, we have never been to Manali and we are totally unaware of the road maps. A car with a GPRS facility will be highly appreciated in this situation. And finally, I hope that there is no need to mention that we are expecting an AC drive in this hot summer.\\nPlease confirm the availability of the vehicle comprising of the aforementioned amenities or an alternative with details, in the case of unavailability. I would be grateful if you can provide the quote for the same. Also, I am looking forward to hearing about any concession from your side on the reservation of the car well in advance with cash payment.\\nIn anticipation of hearing from you soon.\\nYours faithfully,\\nAmita Rukhanee\\n[", "Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI am writing this letter to enquire about a car which I want to rent in order to go on a weeklong holiday with my family. We will travel to different parts of the country and sometimes travel for a long distance.\\nI would prefer to rent a large and spacious minivan with six passenger seats. The car should be fully loaded and automatic. By the way, my grandfather is a person with limited mobility and uses a wheelchair. Therefore, it is absolutely essential that the automobile has enough space in it to keep the wheelchair. I would also like the car to have an automatic sliding door system so that my grandparents can enter and exit the vehicle easily. On top of that, I would also like a car with a rotating seat so that my grandfather can manoeuvre himself easily. And as for the other features, I would like to have a cruise control feature, an anti-lock brake system and heavy-duty tires since we would be travelling quite a long distance.\\nTherefore, based on the requirements above, I would highly appreciate it if you could quote the rental price for me for a whole week.\\nYours faithfully,\\nJames Crowe\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 4.88 (13 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nFormal Letter\\nInquiry Letter\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\nSiris Gita\\n10 years 6 months\\nDear Sir/ Madam,I am writing this letter to inform you about hiring a rental cab from your agency for a short trip to hilly region with my family during this summer vacation. Initially, I need a comfortable four-wheeler cab that has full facilities with eight seats while we go to the hilly region. I think Mahindra Vehicle is suitable for us and would like to know other alternatives from you as well. Afterwards, I would like to hire on the 12th June 2015 to 16th June 2015. When I return from hilly area after finishing our trip, I would hand over the car in time. Similarly, I request about the price for hiring the car. Could you please send me detailed information on cost of 8 seated car vehicle for 5 days in rental? I am really looking forward to your information for a cab. I hope you will reply promptly and arrange everything so that I can rent the car from your company. Yours Sincerely Siris Gita\\nReply\\nQuote\\n×\\nReport\\nReport\\nClose"]'::jsonb,
