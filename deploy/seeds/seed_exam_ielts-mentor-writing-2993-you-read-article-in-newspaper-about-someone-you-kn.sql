  E'["Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI am Stephen Ben, a resident of Brooklyn, New York, and I am writing regarding an article I read on 24th November that was a great read but unfortunately had some incorrect information and facts. The article was basically about professor Albert, a renowned professor at Fordham University whom I personally know.\\nFirst of all, I must state that the article was quite interesting and it gave many insights on how research in local universities can contribute to the national interest and how Professor Albert had been a pioneer on that. I, however, was daunted to notice some blunders in the article that I deem should not have been overlooked. I have been a research assistant for Professor Albert for more than 3 years and we are still in touch.\\nThe fact that Mr Albert is from Germany is incorrect as he is originally from the UK. He achieved his graduation from an American university, not from Australia. Moreover, he is not a father of 4 children, but three. Finally, the bio-hazard digression project that was credited solely to him was actually conducted with the assistance of another professor from the same university. He is Professor Gill and he should have been credited for the work as well.\\nI wish a follow-up article or an editorial correction should clarify those issues as soon as possible.\\nYours faithfully,\\nStephen Ben", "Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI like to read your newspaper as often as I can because of the objective news and informative articles you try to publish. But, I am writing this letter to inform you that the article you wrote on Mr. Gaurav Patel, published on 25th of August, unfortunately, has some wrong information.\\nIn that article, it was written that Mr. Gaurav became involved with some political activities after his retirement which is not true. In fact, during that time, he was merely trying to help a particular political party in organising some kind of charity works in his area to help the poor and distressed people. By the way, I can say this because I know Mr. Gaurav Patel personally for more than ten years and we both live in the same area. He is a very benevolent fundraiser and a very rich but honest industrialist.\\nSo, as you know the truth now, please take some appropriate actions to correct the mistake either by writing a follow-up article or by publishing an editorial correction, whichever you deem fit.\\nThanking you for your attention and consideration.\\nYours faithfully,\\nAmit Agarwal\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 4.45 (10 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nFormal Letter\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\n×\\nReport\\nReport\\nClose"]'::jsonb,
