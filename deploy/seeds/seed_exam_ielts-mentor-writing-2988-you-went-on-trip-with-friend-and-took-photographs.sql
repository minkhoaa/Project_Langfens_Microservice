  E'["Dear Dean,\\nHow are you? I guess you have got busy with your new job and voluntary social works that you are very active in. I wish I have been more active like you! I would like to thank you for making our trip to Brazil so interesting.\\nOur trip to Brazil was amazing and the vibrant activities we had there are unforgettable. I still remember our day at Pelourinho, the historic centre of Salvador. I particularly relished the old town as it was filled with graceful tranquillity, colourfully painted pastel buildings, and music in the streets. Can you recall how we screamed with joy the time we saw a city we have only seen in movies before? It was an astonishing experience.\\nDo you have the copy of the picture you took in which I was standing amind of a crowd as if I was a local resident? The picture portrayed a different me in it and the lighting worked like magic. I am unfortunate to find that I do not have a copy of this picture. I must have placed it somewhere or lost it.\\nThis photograph is special as it reminds me of a great trip we had together. I liked this photo the most as it captured a smiling myself in a mysterious town at a strange outset. I was so overwhelmed with the beauty of this town that I forgot to take pictures. I would be grateful if you can send me that particular picture at your convenience.\\nTake care and stay fine.\\nWarm wishes,\\nSam", "Dear Rumi,\\nHope you are doing well. Just to let you know again, I think that my recent trip to Turkey with you was one of the best ones I have ever had. In fact, I would have never known that Turkey, and especially the city of Istanbul, was such a beautiful place had I not visited there with you.\\nAnyway, I am writing this letter to request a copy of the photographs that we took in the Hagia Sophia Museum. This particular picture to me was one of the best and most favourite since I looked really live and happy in that picture unlike in many other pictures in which I looked either tired or serious. But, unfortunately, when I was looking at this picture and talking about my experience on our recent trip to Turkey to one of my cousins over a cup of coffee, I accidentally spilt my coffee on it. Not to mention, the picture got damaged after that accident.\\nSo, I would really appreciate it if you could mail me a copy of that picture because you have a copy of that picture with you also.\\nTake care and write to me sometimes.\\nWarm wishes,\\nStephen\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 4.94 (8 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nGT Writing Task 1\\nInformal Letter\\nPersonal Letter\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\n×\\nReport\\nReport\\nClose"]'::jsonb,
