  E'["Dear Mr Hopkins,\\nI have got your contact details from my teacher, Mr Abel, from the University of Aldora, and I am writing to you regarding the Spanish tuition classes that you offer to non-native English speakers. I am hoping that you would accept me as an apprentice.\\nLast year, I applied for a visit visa to Chile, and I am glad to inform you that I have recently been granted my visa after waiting for 6 long months. As a well-travelled person, who has facile command of the Spanish Language, I hope that you can assist me in learning this beautiful language. My mentor told me that you might be willing to deliver a crash course in the Spanish Language to me so that I will be well equipped to hold conversations in Spanish before I embark on my South American adventure.\\nSince my flight leaves on the 25th of August 2025, I am hoping you could start tutoring me as soon as practically possible.\\nI await your kind response.\\nYours sincerely,\\nSam Duke\\n[", "Dear Mr Haruki,\\nHope this letter finds you in good health and spirit. First of all, please let me apologize to you because I am writing this letter to you without your prior permission, but I am writing on the advice of a well-respected person, whom you know personally, named Mr Jonathon Kyle.\\nMr Jonathon, my mentor, has spoken very highly of you. Now, please allow me to spell out why I am writing a letter to you. Actually, I am planning to learn the Japanese language, and I was told that you could teach me this language within a short period of time. I have heard that your teaching method is very proficient and it will certainly be helpful to me. I would also love to learn about how to be proficient in business communication in the Japanese language from you.\\nAnyway, in case if you are wondering, I think that learning the Japanese language would provide me with some extra leverage in obtaining international employment opportunities, especially, in Japan. Besides, I have a few friends in Japan with whom I would like to talk to in their native language. And, I am ready to take the language lesson as soon as you ask.\\nSo, please let me know when I can start, and what I need to do before you can be ready to provide the language lesson for me.\\nYours faithfully,\\nRobin Singh\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 4.94 (8 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nSemi-formal Letter\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\n×\\nReport\\nReport\\nClose"]'::jsonb,
