  E'["Dear Mr and Mrs Patrick,\\nI am so glad to hear that you are going to have a surprise birthday party for Chris, which I believe he will enjoy so much. But, as much as I would love to surprise my good friend, the problem is that I will not be able to attend the party, next week, because I will remain very busy at that time.\\nNext week, I will need to complete the quarterly financial audit works of my company to come clean with the government tax authority. These audit works can be so complicated and painful at times that we even have to work very late at night to get the job done.\\nOf course, whether I attend his surprise party or not, I am pretty sure that Chris will fully enjoy the occasion because he will be surrounded by many of his well-wishers to cheer him up. Not only that but also Chris has such a cheerful personality that he never lets a good occasion pass by without enjoying it! And that is exactly why I have already made a plan to see him at a horse racing competition on the Sapphire coast, next month so that we can both enjoy some time together!\\nYours sincerely,\\nGlenn Moore", "Dear Mr. and Mrs. Cooper,\\nI hope you are both doing well. I was delighted to receive your invitation to Chris’s surprise birthday party. I can already imagine how thrilled Chris will be! He has always loved surprises, and with all his close friends and family around, I am sure this celebration will be truly special for him.\\nUnfortunately, I won’t be able to attend the party as I have to be at the airport to receive one of my aunts in the evening on that day. I simply cannot reschedule it even though I would very much want to! I am really disappointed to miss such a wonderful occasion, but I know Chris will have an amazing time with everyone there.\\nHowever, I would love to make it up to him! I was thinking of taking Chris out for a special lunch the following weekend at his favourite restaurant. That way, I can celebrate his birthday with him in a more personal way and also hear all about the surprise party!\\nThank you again for the kind invitation. I hope the party turns out to be a fantastic and memorable event. Please do pass on my best wishes to Chris!\\nWarm regards,\\nLucas", "Dear Mr and Mrs Jones,\\nI am excited to hear that you will be arranging a surprise birthday party for Chris next month. I am honoured to be invited to this party that will give us a good reason to enjoy. However, I will be visiting my hometown at that time and can not make it to this party.\\nChris will love this party, especially since his close university friends will be there to cheer him up. It will also be a fabulous occasion for him as he is stressed out a bit from a few deadlines in his new office. I am sure you will have many memorable events at his birthday party.\\nAs much as I would like to be present at the party, I just can not miss an appointment to take my father to the doctor on the same day. The specialist doctor, to whom I will take my father, comes from a different state and is available only for three days. That is why I will travel to my hometown two days before Chir''s birthday and return a day after his birthday party.\\nI would, however, meet him a week after his birthday and present him with a gift from my side. On that occasion, I hope to spend some time outdoors with him or even arrange a dinner party at my home.\\nThank you once again for inviting me.\\nYours sincerely,\\nAlfred Kinsey\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 3.94 (9 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nGT Writing Task 1\\nSemi-formal Letter\\nLetter Writing Sample\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\nDarpan\\n1 year 5 months\\nIELTS Letter Question:\\nYou recently bought an electric gadget for your home.

I’m so glad to hear that you’re thinking of buying a new gadget for your home - especially after seeing the electric air fryer I recently purchased. I thought I’d tell you more about it and offer a few tips that might help you decide.\\nThe model I bought is the Philips Rapid Air Fryer HD9252, and I honestly couldn’t be happier with it. It’s compact, easy to use, and makes cooking far healthier by using little to no oil. I’ve been using it to prepare everything from crispy fries to grilled chicken and even roasted vegetables. The cooking time is fast, and cleanup is surprisingly easy.\\nThat said, there are some great alternatives worth considering. If you''re looking for something more budget-friendly, the Cosori Lite offers similar features at a lower price. Or, if you''re interested in more versatility, the Ninja Dual Zone Air Fryer is great for preparing two different dishes at the same time.\\nLet me know what you decide! I’d be happy to help you compare a few models.\\nBest wishes,\\nUsman\\nReply\\nQuote\\nLarysa\\n2 years 6 months\\nDear Mr and Mrs Smith,\\nI am very grateful for the invitation to Chris''s surprise birthday party! That means a lot. I am sure that Chris will be very excited about it and would enjoy the birthday party to a great extent. He has been talking about a party for the last few weeks and I am sure this will make him so happy. As much as I would love to join this party, unfortunately, I can''t do it due to some other unavoidable responsibilitie s.\\nExactly on that day, I have to catch a flight for a business trip to London. This trip had been arranged by my office at least a month ago and there is no way I can avoid this. I''m pretty sure that Chris''s friends won''t let him get bored and cheer him up with great enthusiasm!\\nOn my turn, I would meet Chris immediately upon return from my trip in our favourite cafe and present him my surprise gift, which I have already prepared long before his birthday.\\nOnce more, thank you for the invitation, and I wish Chris cheerful and jolly birthday party!\\nYours sincerely,\\nNick Goodman\\nReply\\nQuote\\n×\\nReport\\nReport\\nClose"]'::jsonb,
