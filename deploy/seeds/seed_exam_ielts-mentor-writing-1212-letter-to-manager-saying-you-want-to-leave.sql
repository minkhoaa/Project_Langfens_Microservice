  E'["Dear Mrs Alisha,\\nI am writing to formally notify you that I have decided to resign from my position effective from the 1st of March. I would like to express my gratitude for the wonderful five years that I have spent working with you at Jones Incorporation.\\nWorking as a sales supervisor for almost half a decade in your esteemed organisation was one of the best opportunities in my life. I have gained valuable experience in dealing with customers and promoting products which I believe will help me further advance my career. Moreover, the coworkers, seniors and the management had been like a family to me. I enjoyed working for this company to a great extent.\\nI have recently accepted an offer at a managerial position in Dunken''s Brothers Company. I am expected to join there at the beginning of March. Hence, I would like you to discharge me from my responsibilities before 1st August 2020. In the meantime, I will hand over my assigned tasks and finish my works.\\nI will always remember the excellent time that I have spent working for you. I wish eternal progress and success for the company and the team.\\nYours faithfully,\\nRien Taylor", "Dear Mr Alfred,\\nI am writing this letter to inform you of my decision to leave Pedagogy Technologies effective from the 2nd of December 2025. I would always be grateful for the opportunities you have given me. I am hoping you would complete the official procedure to discharge me from my responsibilities before the mentioned date.\\nDuring my tenure of four years, I have enjoyed my work and have learned a great deal. When I joined the company, I was a fresher and did not know much about corporate life. But having spent 4 years with Pedagogy Technologies, I am not only well versed with the technical aspect of Campaign Management but also mastered the methodologies and techniques used in this sector.\\nI am glad to be a part of campaign management and planning. I particularly enjoyed interacting with clients and cherished the success of the team. I have made some good friends and will miss them horribly.\\nSadly, all good things come to an end, and now I think it is time for me to take a step forward. I have decided to pursue my MBA qualification in marketing and have been selected in one of the UK''s best universities.\\nI would like to thank you for providing me with your support and guidance during my tenure with the company.\\nYours faithfully,\\nPreeti Ghuraiya\\n[ by - Preeti Ghuraiya]\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 5.00 (8 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nGT Writing Task 1\\nSemi-formal Letter\\nRegisnation-letter\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\n×\\nReport\\nReport\\nClose"]'::jsonb,
