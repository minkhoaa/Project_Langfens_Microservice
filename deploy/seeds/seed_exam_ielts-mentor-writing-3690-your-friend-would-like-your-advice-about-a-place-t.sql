  E'["Dear Kim,\\nFirst of all, let me congratulate you on your success in gaining admission to a great university where I also studied. I''d also like to thank you at the same time for having confidence in my advice in finding accommodation for you.\\nOf course, the best way to find accommodation at your university is to go over the daily local newspaper''s “classified” section where many local residents post advertisements to rent out their flats to students. You could also try reading the “student union” notice boards where students frequently post ads to either find suitable roommates or share their flats.\\nBy the way, you could also live in one of those single-bedroom apartments on Jenkins Avenue where I also lived as a student of that university. These single bedrooms are a bit pricey, but you would probably like them because of their calm and nice environment.\\nBut, wherever you choose to reside, please just make sure that the flat or home, you decide to rent, has a good central heating system because that place can get really cold during the winter.\\nWishing you all the best.\\nWarm wishes,\\nMinh", "Dear Lee,\\nI’m excited to learn from your letter that you’ve been offered a place at The University of London! Congratulations! I''m sure you''ll enjoy studying at that university. However, finding the right place to live while you''re a university student is important, so I’m glad you reached out for my advice.\\nWhen I was a student at that university, I lived in university halls of residence during my first year. It was a great way to meet new people and adjust to university life. Later, I moved into a shared house with friends, which was more affordable and gave me more independence.\\nFor your search, I recommend starting with the university accommodation office since they often have good options, including on-campus and recommended private rentals. Websites like Rightmove, SpareRoom, and local Facebook groups are also useful for finding student houses and flats.\\nBe careful of common mistakes! Many students rush into signing a contract without fully checking the property. Make sure you view the place in person, check for hidden costs (like bills not being included), and read the rental agreement carefully before committing. Also, be wary of landlords who ask for large upfront deposits and always check if they are registered with a deposit protection scheme.\\nLet me know if you need more help, and best of luck with your move!\\nWarm wishes,\\nJeremy\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 3.79 (26 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nGT Writing Task 1\\nemail writing\\nemail to friend\\nLetter Writing Sample\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\nPR\\n3 years 4 months\\nIELTS Email Writing:\\nYour friend has been offered a place on a course at the university where you studied. He/She would like your advice about finding a place to live.\\nWrite an email to your friend.\\nDear Andre,\\nHope you''re keeping well. It’s been a long time since we met. Many congratulations on your admission to SRCC. As I also graduated from the same university, I would like to recommend you to the Grand Madhu PG for accommodation. It is located near the campus, and the food is homely. Moreover, and rooms have beautiful views and a serene environment.\\nIf rooms are already occupied, I''d share your contact details with a couple of my friends in the area. Although they would be busy during the weekdays, I hope they would definitely help you out over the weekend. This would save the commission money you''d otherwise have paid to the broker for finding you PG.\\nLastly, there is one mistake that many students usually make while finding accommodation which is opting for a shared space. It seems a good option in the beginning but later on, it ends up in dispute related to privacy issues. So it’s better to spend some extra money but chose an individual room.\\nI''ve shared my personal opinion with you. Hope that will help you. If you need any further details, I''m just a call away.\\nWarm wishes\\nPR Pram\\nReply\\nQuote\\nChetan Mehta\\n3 years 6 months\\nIELTS GT Writing Task 1 (Letter Writing):\\nYour friend has been offered a place on a course at the university where you studied. He/she would like your advice about finding a place to live.\\nWrite an email to your friend. In your email,\\n-describe where you lived when you were a student at the university\\n-recommend the best way for him/her to look for accommodation\\n-warn him/her of mistakes students make when choosing accommodation\\nWrite at least 150 words.\\nSample Email Answer:\\nDear Shaurya,\\nFirst of all, many congratulations to you for securing a position at your desired university, where I''ve spent almost 4 years during my graduation.\\nAs I told you before, while studying at the university, I used to live in a hostel near the university campus. It is a great place for students as it is adjacent to the university campus, has a low rent, and has a mess providing nice food at a reasonable monthly charge.\\nYou can also try searching on the Kijiji app for some accommodations nearby. It gives very nice recommendations , and you can choose one that fits your needs and budget. Alternatively, you can look for the student union''s notice board to find the rent notice. Just look if other students are looking for roommates to share the accommodation.\\nAnd I also would like to warn you about a big scam that students face while looking for accommodation and that is the fake middle-men that you meet up with while you are exploring different places searching for accommodation. They convince you with their sweet talks and take money from you in the name of token money for accommodation. Don''t even talk to such a broker.\\nWishing you luck in your time at the university.\\nWarm wishes\\nChetan\\nReply\\nQuote\\nSukhjeet\\n3 years 6 months\\nAmazing.\\nReply\\nQuote\\nSukhjeet Kaur\\n3 years 6 months\\nI love it.\\nReply\\nQuote\\nAmir\\n3 years 6 months\\nDear Erfan,\\nCongratulations on finally achieving your goal and being accepted by MIT University, where I have spent my entire postgraduate years.\\nKeeping track of your costs is critical if you''re a student. The first two years of my study were spent in a basement on Wills Street. Being only five minutes away from campus, you may find it to be the right option.\\nKijiji is by far the most reliable source for finding a place to stay among the many sources available to you. This is a well-known website that connects you directly to landlords without any middlemen. It''s so competitive because the prices are so low, so you shouldn''t let this chance slip away.\\nThe majority of my friends decided to choose expensive accommodations, but you will spend most of your time researching in the Lab, so your room is just for rest and sleeping. Also, by looking into the advertisements you may want to consider Kelves street on the downside of campus since prices are low there, but remember that the ground is so slippery in that area in the winter, and it is extremely difficult to reach the main drive, so I would recommend keeping it off the list.\\nBest Wishes,\\nAmir\\nReply\\nQuote\\n×\\nReport\\nReport\\nClose"]'::jsonb,
