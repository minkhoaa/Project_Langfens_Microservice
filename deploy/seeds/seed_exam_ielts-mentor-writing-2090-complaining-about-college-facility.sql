  E'["Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI am a third-year accounting major student in your college and I am writing to you regarding a problem that I have encountered several times over the past few weeks in our football ground. I am hoping that you would take steps to solve the matter immediately.\\nIn relation to the issue, our football team is preparing for the upcoming competition against FC College, and the training is very hard - both mentally and physically. Hence we sometimes get very lethargic towards the end of our training sessions. But I am extremely alarmed at the fact that the faucet at the ground appears to be out of order, therefore, my teammates and I can’t quench our thirsts during and after the practice. Because of this, I suffered from dehydration a few days ago and had to be rushed to the hospital.\\nMy intention in writing this letter to you is to ask for a working condition faucet for drinking water so that we can carry on our practice sessions without risking our health.\\nExpecting your kind attention and prompt action regarding this.\\nYours sincerely,\\nSameed Qureshi\\n[", "Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI am a science major in your college and very proud to be a member of this prestigious institution. However, I am writing to notify you of some problems we, the residential students, are facing for the last few weeks. I am hoping that you would take steps to solve those problems as early as possible.\\nIn relation to the specifics of the first problem, the only photocopy machine that we have in our college is out of order for over a month. We often need to travel to the nearest market for any photocopy requirement and it kills our valuable time. Moreover, our college canteen no longer maintains a healthy diet and due to this, I have had severe stomach pain last week. I had to visit a doctor and the test report outlines food poisoning. This same fate waited for some other students who ate in the canteen last week.\\nI hope you can imagine the difficulty we are going through. I would really appreciate it if you could intervene and solve the problems that are harshly affecting us.\\nI hope you would take steps to solve our misery.\\nYours faithfully,\\nRobert Buckley\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 4.70 (10 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nGT Writing Task 1\\nFormal Letter\\nComplaints-letter\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\nRam\\n7 years 8 months\\nWrite a letter to your college’s administration department complaining about the college’s facilities.In your letter include: what the problem is how this problem has affected you what the college should do to fix this problemLetter Answer: Dear Sir,I am writing to bring to your attention to a problem we are facing in the computer lab.I am a third-year student of Computer Science and Engineering department. We have a serious problem in the computer lab - there is no power backup facility. Our computers shut down at power failure and often important data are lost. This can damage the computers and at the same time, a lot of time is getting wasted. While we practice on computers in the lab, power failure is affecting our studies and learning. As we are approaching semester final, this will affect our exam scores. Considering all these facts, it would be great if you take appropriate action to solve the problem by providing power backups to computers or alternatives like arranging generators to run the computer uninterruptedly . We would request you to take prompt action to alleviate the grave issue. Thanking you in advance. Yours faithfully,John\\nReply\\nQuote\\nWilliam Oh\\n10 years 4 months\\nGood writing samples.
