  E'["Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI am writing to inform you that I could not get on the flight from Dublin to Tokyo on 21st March due to mismanagement at the airport. I would like you to rectify the issue and arrange my next flight for 24th March.\\nI booked my flight with your airline two weeks ago and was scheduled to fly to Tokyo from Dublin airport at 2100 hours on 21st March 2025. I reached the airport three hours prior to my schedule and checked in my luggage. When I was ready to take my flight, an airport security personnel approached me and asked me to follow him to the security room for interrogation. I was quite baffled by the sudden inquest and tried to be as helpful as possible. However, the damage has already been made. I missed my flight when I was cleared and due to this, I could not attend an important meeting at our Tokyo office. I notified my employer immediately and they asked me to take the next flight, which was not available until 24th March.\\nI would like you to rectify this unexpected investigation within your jurisdiction and book my flight on 24th March without imposing any new ticket price on me.\\nI look forward to hearing from you soon.\\nYours faithfully,\\nEvan Piera", "Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI am writing this letter to inform you that I missed my international flight to London on 17th January for a reason which was beyond my control and which actually transpired due to a problem at the airport.\\nMy flight was scheduled at 12:30 pm and I had arrived at the airport well in advance. Suddenly, I felt that I needed to eat something at the airport, and so I went to one of the upscale restaurants at the airport where some security personnel of the airport asked everyone to stay there until further notice. I guess it was a security issue,  which eventually forced me to abandon my flight. Anyway, missing the fight caused me to miss an important seminar on launching a new product.\\nSo, since I missed the flight because of a reason, which was beyond my control and had something to do with the airport authority, I would truly appreciate it if you give me a full refund for my ticket. I am attaching the ticket with this letter for your convenience.\\nYours faithfully,\\nLe Nhan Tong\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 4.03 (17 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nGT Writing Task 1\\nFormal Letter\\nComplaints-letter\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\nRaj\\n4 years 6 months\\nYou missed a flight due to a problem at the airport.\\nWrite a letter to the airline.

I would like you to rectify the issue and arrange a fight for me on 27th August.\\nI booked an air ticket two weeks before flying from Dubai to Singapore with your airlines and the flight number was GB-542014. The journey date was scheduled on 23rd August at 21:00 hrs and I reached the airport well ahead of the schedule. Then, I got the boarding ticket and proceeded to the security entry point, where your employees should have been with me and help me with the security clearance. But due to bad intel, the security personnel took me to the security office for further investigation. None of your employees came to help me with the situation. The security employee took an hour to ask me different questions and finally, they apologised and I was free to go. However, in the meantime, I missed my flight.\\nAs a result of this, I could not attend an important meeting at our Singapore business trade office. I notified my office immediately about this, and my office has advised me to fly to Singapore on the next flight on 27th August.\\nI would like you to rectify why I was not helped by your airlines and why I was left alone! Also, please arrange my flight on 27th August with your flight reservation without imposing any new air ticket price on me.\\nI look forward to hearing from you.\\nYours faithfully,\\nSusan Adrian\\nReply\\nQuote\\nBowale Oyenuga\\n5 years\\nDear Sir or Madam,\\nI am writing to express my disappointment about the security breaches at your airline which hindered my flight to the United Kingdom.\\nOn Sunday 22nd June, 5:30 pm, I was meant to be placed on Airline LB9882, a flight to London. My ticket number is Ty223. But to my surprise, and to some other passengers as well, we got to know that the airline’s database has been compromised and no passenger booked for that hour could proceed with their flights.\\nThis was a really devastating experience for me because I was not able to book another flight with another airline at that moment which left me with no choice than to cancel the trip. The trip was meant to be my first visit to the United Kingdom for a conference held by Microsoft of which I would have had the opportunity to meet other professionals in my field for a better opportunity in my carrier.\\nThis is quite unfortunate and I would advise that the Airline provides a solid cybersecurity training for the IT team and ensure that Cybersecurity experts are invited to evaluate the level of your security hardening. Also, since I was not able to make my trip, I would use the moment to request a full refund of my ticket deposit.\\nKindly reach me on 299929832. Looking forward to hearing from you.\\nYours faithfully,\\nBow Hom\\nReply\\nQuote\\n×\\nReport\\nReport\\nClose"]'::jsonb,
