  E'["Dear Flemming,\\nI''d like to thank you for hosting an incredible party last month when I got the chance to meet your parents, who, in my opinion, are exceptional individuals. I''d love to meet them again. However, I''m writing today to request you to visit Denmark with me.\\nI had long been planning to visit Denmark, a remarkable country, and have finally decided to travel there on 27th December. I''d rather have you with me than travel alone. You''re the best travel companion I can think of, and our last vacation to Malaysia propels me to invite you to be my tour companion again.\\nOur semester final is over, and we''ve two weeks to do something before returning to our classes. I thought travelling to a Scandinavian country would be the best way to spend our holidays. My uncle resides in Copenhagen, and he''ll be a great help there.\\nI plan to visit my uncle and meet his family first. Then we''ll visit Roskilde Cathedral, Viking Ship Museum, take a castle tour from Copenhagen and enjoy the countryside. I''m also open to your recommendation about the things to do in Denmark.\\nI hope you''ll not turn me down and finalise your preparation to have a memorable tour to Denmark in December.\\nWarm wishes,\\nDavid", "Dear Robin,\\nI haven’t heard from you in a while, so I hope that everything is well with you. You''d be excited to hear that I''m going to visit Germany to enjoy a surprise holiday at the beginning of the next month, and I want you to go with me because I know how you''ve always liked a country like Germany for managing to rise like a phoenix from the rubble of the most devastating war in human history.\\nI am taking this one-week holiday because my company has granted me a leave recently for completing a difficult project way ahead of its delivery date. I chose Germany as the destination because of its extraordinary beauty and distinctive culture.\\nNow, as for the holiday plans, we''ll stay in the beautiful city of Cologne where we will visit some of the oldest universities in Europe and one of the largest and most beautifully built Cathedrals. After that, we''ll head to the Rhine Valley which arguably has some of the most beautiful landscapes in entire Germany. Then, of course, we''ll enjoy the gentle cruise in the Rhine River while looking at the charming riverside town. Finally, beautiful castles are something which we should never want to miss.\\nSo, let me know what you think about my plans.\\nWarm wishes,\\nThomas\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 4.81 (13 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nGT Writing Task 1\\nInformal Letter\\nPersonal Letter\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\nFadi Al-Damiri\\n7 years 9 months\\nYou are planning a holiday in another country and would like a friend to accompany you.Write a letter to the friend asking him/her to join you and explain: - Why are you taking a holiday? - What is your holiday plan? - Why would you like him/her to go with you?Dear Sara,It was great to get your postcard from London yesterday and I''m thrilled to hear that you''ve been promoted to the executive manager position in your company. It was also lovely to see your family when they visited us last summer. We miss you very much.Last week, I won a prize in a quiz competition and you won''t believe what the prize is! It is air-tickets for two to the USA. That was unusual but I have decided to take the advantage and have a trip to the USA. So, I would like you to take the trip with me and spend some quality time. I hope you would be able to manage a week''s leave and accompany me during the holidays. You are my best buddy and I want to take you to make the holiday special. I''ve already planned for this vacation and the places we should visit. I have primarily relied on TripAdvisor for the places-to-visit and things-to-do and I am sure you will love it. We will spend some time on Florida beaches and visit Statue of Liberty, Universal Studios Hollywood, Metropolitan Museum of Art and a trip to Las Vegas.I think this is an overwhelming opportunity for both of us, isn''t it?Hope to hear from you very soon. Take care.With lots of love, Fadi\\nReply\\nQuote\\n×\\nReport\\nReport\\nClose"]'::jsonb,
