  E'["Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI am writing in regards to a lost bag on a plane that I took to reach London from New York on 17th August. Unfortunately, I forgot my bag on the plane. When I reached the hotel, I realised I had left my bag. I am hoping you would help me recover it along with its content immediately.\\nMy flight number was VG-4587F and my seat number was D-54A. Onboard, I kept the bag under my seat as all the overhead bins were filled with bags and luggage. When I left the airport in London, I forget to take my bag with me. It is a black leather bag, medium in size and has two pockets in the front and one in the back. Also, it has a silver zip and keychain on it.\\nMy bag contains some important documents, a few dresses of mine and a small brown purse which had my ID card, driving licence, and some cash. The documents in the bag are really significant and I need to submit them to my office next week. So if you could help me find the bag, I would be really grateful.\\nI can come and collect it from the airport promptly. Thank you for your kind attention and cooperation.\\nYours faithfully,\\nSonia Vincent\\n[", "Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI am writing regarding a bag that I left on one of your planes last week. On 24th November, I travelled to London on flight FRC- 2547-A  from Sydney. According to my ticket, my seat number was D-5A. The bag contains some important documents which I need immediately. I am hoping you would help me find the lost bag.\\nAfter I reached my hotel in London, I realised I had left my bag on the plane under the seat in front of me. I felt pretty silly about the mistake. My bag is small in size and is made of brown leather with a zip on the top. Inside the bag, I have put a credit card, a debit card, a book that I was reading titled \\"War and Peace\\" by Leo Tolstoy, some car keys, my mobile phone and some important business documents. I need these documents within a few days and they are very important to me.\\nI, therefore, request you to have your lost property department check and see if they have my bag and contact me as soon as possible. I can be reached on my mobile phone at +029940546484 or on my email at\\nThis email address is being protected from spambots.

I look forward to hearing from you soon.\\nYours faithfully,\\nSharon Mond\\n[", "Dear Sir or Madam,\\nLast week, I took one of your direct flights to fly from Kuala Lumpur to London. My flight was on 27th June and the flight number was NR-15478. But, unfortunately, when I left the plane, I left my cross-body bag in it.\\nHowever, I came to know about the lost bag only after I had arrived at my hotel when I needed to show my reservation documents to the hotel authority. I always hang that men’s bag around my shoulder, but, when I was flying in your aircraft and sat near block D, I, unfortunately, left it in the overhead locker above the seats. And that’s probably what caused me to forget about the bag.\\nTo give you some idea about my bag and its contents, it is a brown colour leather bag which is about 10 inches wide, 12 inches long and 6 inches in diameter and is made by Kenneth Cole. The bag contains important documents from my office, copies of my travel documents, as well as personal items like a hair clipper (comb), a trimmer and an ebook reader.\\nSo, once you find the bag, please give me a call and then courier it to my office address which is attached on one side of the bag at your earliest convenience. If this is not possible, I can visit your office and collect it myself.\\nYours faithfully,\\nMitchel Moore\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 4.95 (10 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nGT Writing Task 1\\nFormal Letter\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\nVineeth\\n10 years 5 months\\nDear sir, I am writing to intimate you about my bag that I left out in the flight compartment. I would appeal for an instant query on the same. On my fly back to London last morning, on your airlines Boeing 657 from New York, I was terribly sick with a headache and somehow I forgot to fetch my hand carry from the flight. The flight stewards did not bother to cross check the cabinets either. I am sure about finding bag on the cabinet above my seat.w-17. My bag is black in colour, leather made with my initials Jones printed on its body. To be sure, one can find some star trek stickers on the top, beside the handle. Its contents mainly include some medicines, letter pad, papers and a handy cam. Off these, medicines are most important as I am an asthma patient. Now given the situation I would like you to find my bag and return it to me at the earliest , else you can reach me on 0556458833 and I would collect it from your office.hoping for a prompt reply from your side.Thanking you,Jones.\\nReply\\nQuote\\n×\\nReport\\nReport\\nClose"]'::jsonb,
