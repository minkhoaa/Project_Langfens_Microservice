  E'["Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI am writing to express my dissatisfaction with a blender machine that I purchased from your store and the poor customer service I received afterwards. I am hoping you would replace the faulty product, and improve your customer service as well.\\nLast week, I purchased a ‘White Line’ blender from your store from your Madison Avenue store. After I brought it home and tried to make a smoothie in it, the blades got clogged and have not been functioning properly since then even after I cleaned it properly. In shock and awe, I called the customer service, but I was told by the salesperson that she could do nothing about it as she is not responsible for any problems that may arise after taking the product home. Since this purchase had cost me a small fortune, I have been inordinately stressed about the situation.\\nMy intention in writing this letter is to request you to replace this broken blender of mine with a new one as I have a three-year warranty on this blender. Further, I expect you to issue a show-cause notice to your salesperson about her coarse demeanour towards me.\\nI anticipate prompt remedial action from your side.\\nYours faithfully,\\nSam Adams\\n[by -\\nSameed Qureshi\\n]", "Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI am writing to express my dissatisfaction with a recent purchase from your store. I bought a blender from your shop a week ago and it malfunctioned the very next day. I am hoping that you would replace it immediately or refund me the full amount.\\nI purchased a Morphy Richards Express Blender from your shop on 18th May 2025. I came home and installed the blender the next morning by following the instructions provided in the manual. To my surprise, the blender did not switch on. I tried to do it a few more times before I finally phoned your shop. The order number is 23650247 and I am attaching a copy of my receipt.\\nJudy, who answered the phone, confirmed that the installation steps were correct and suggested that it may be a manufacturing defect. She assured me that the equipment would be replaced and that someone from the shop would arrive to collect the blender.\\nIt has been five days since then and I am yet to be contacted by someone from your shop. I request you to look into the matter and suggest a solution. I am ready to drive down to the shop to hand over the blender, in case, a pickup cannot be arranged. Kindly replace it with a new one or refund me the full amount after you read this letter.\\nLooking forward to a speedy resolution.\\nYours faithfully,\\nJames Walker\\n[ by\\nJayita Das\\n]", "Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI am writing this letter to express my disappointment with the induction stove that I purchased from your shop a couple of days ago. I found it in working condition initially, but then after a few hours of use, it malfunctioned. I contacted your shop and was assured a quick solution but nothing has been done since then. I am hoping you would replace it with a fresh one immediately.\\nI was very excited to purchase it but disappointed to find that it had manufacturing flaws. While using the stove, I tried to increase the operating temperature. But I could not do so and it takes a much longer time than needed to cook anything. I am distressed that the sole purpose for its purchase failed and I ended up purchasing a faulty product. The invoice number is 254107 and I am attaching the receipt with this letter. I called the customer care officer of your store but he failed to propose any solution despite his assurance.\\nIt would be great if you could replace my faulty induction stove with a new one since it has a valid warranty for two years. I think this matter deserves your attention and so address this problem immediately.\\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\\nYours faithfully,\\nNivetha Kumar\\n[by -\\nNivetha\\n]", "Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI am writing to express my utter disappointment regarding the food factory device that I purchased from your shop a few days ago. I was very excited to purchase this kitchen appliance but disappointed to find that it was poorly made and has a manufacturing flaw.\\nI visited your shop on 4th November and purchased a brand new Philips food factory that comes with two years warranty. However, to my sheer astonishment, when I unwrapped the box and tried to run the device, it did not work. I thoroughly checked all the connections as the problem could have been on my end but this was not the case. Immediately, I called the shop and complained about the faulty product. I also provided all the details the person on the other side of the phone requested. He assured me that a company representative will be visiting me in a couple of days and replace the product. But this has never proved to be true. The order number is 8541203 and I am attaching a copy of my receipt.\\nI urge you to immediately address the issue and replace the faulty product with a new and fresh one.\\nYours faithfully,\\nMubashir Noorani\\n[by -\\nNoorani\\n]\\nIELTS Letter Writing Topic:\\nYou have recently bought a piece of equipment for your kitchen but it did not work.

At first, I thought it was a connection problem with the power supply so I have it checked by a technician but it was not the case.

I found it in working condition initially but after 2 days, the touch screen malfunctioned. When I claimed my warranty for the product, I was turned down.During the past few years, I have bought many products and equipment from your shop. I was always satisfied with the product and service you offer. However, this time it was not the case. Earlier today, I called your customer service department about the problem but they blamed me for that and instead of listening to what I wanted to say, they behaved rudely. They hung up on me and that was unprofessional.I have a valid warranty for the product and I have recorded the whole conversation with your customer service representative. I want my product replaced within the next few days as it is covered by a replacement warranty and need a good explanation for the behaviour of your staff. Otherwise, I would be contacting my lawyer to take legal actions about it. I am looking forward to a prompt response from you regarding this. Yours faithfully,Jari ya Sununta\\nReply\\nQuote\\nAdam\\n7 years 10 months\\nI like this.\\nReply\\nQuote\\nEmad A. M. Ziedan\\n10 years 7 months\\nDear Sir / Madam,I am writing to express my deep concern and dissatisfaction about not only the defective new dishwasher I bought recently from your shop but also the weak response of your customer service department.The issue began last week when I assembled the machine taking into consideration all the instructions provided with the user manual. Unfortunately, the machine did not work when I switched it on for the first time! I was quite surprised with the poor quality of such expensive model. However, I immediately contacted your customer service staff who promised to send a technician within 2 days in order to either repair the dishwasher in place or replace it in case it is unrepairable. A week time has passed already without resolving the matter. Such substandard performance disappointed me and I am seriously thinking of not dealing with your shop anymore.You are asked to take an immediate and serious action to sort out that issue. Otherwise, I will be forced to raise my complaint to the Consumer Protection Agency.I am looking forward to hearing from you soon.Yours faithfully.Emad Zeidan\\nReply\\nQuote\\n×\\nReport\\nReport\\nClose"]'::jsonb,
