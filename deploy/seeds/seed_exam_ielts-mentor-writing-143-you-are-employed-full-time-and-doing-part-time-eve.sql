  E'["Dear Mr Phillip,\\nI am a pupil of your evening Spanish language course in which I got enrolled last week. However, I will not be able to continue the course due to a sudden foreign official tour. I am hoping that you would allow me to intake it from next semester.\\nI am working in the risk management division of Prime Bank Limited. This bank has a subsidiary company in Hong Kong where an incident has been reported by the governing authority. For that, I will have to travel to Hong Kong next week with a team to analyze the whole situation, scrutinise the allegations against the company and take appropriate measures. The whole process might take more than two months, and I cannot continue my evening language course right now.\\nUnder the circumstances, I would like to request you to transfer me to the next semester and allow me to take the course without any further registration.\\nYour cooperation in this regard will be highly appreciated.\\nYours sincerely,\\nSafayet Ullah", "Dear Dr. Jones,\\nI am one of your students from the evening course you conduct on treating emergencies in the BMM Medical University. I am writing to inform you that I can no longer attend your evening lectures due to the recent work pressure from my job, but I am willing to complete the course.\\nI am working as a full-time nurse at Thompson Hospital. My shift usually ends at 5.00 pm. However, due to an increasing number of patients in our hospital in the last couple of weeks, I find it impossible to leave the hospital before 6.00 pm and thus have missed many of your lectures. This disappoints me a lot since I understand how important it is for me to complete this course.\\nAs a solution and since I really want to finish this course, I would be grateful if you could consider letting me study for the course from home. My job is closely related to treating the patient with accidents, and I feel I can learn every point of the course in practice. In addition, I have read almost every book you recommended as the supplementary reading for your lectures and can follow your lecture sheets at home.\\nI hope to get your approval on this. I am looking forward to receiving your response soon.\\nSincerely yours,\\nNadia Afsana", "Dear Mr Richard,\\nI registered for the Social Marketing evening course at the Cambridge Institute of Technology last July. This is a useful course for my professional growth but sadly it contradicts my office schedule and I find no other way than to discontinue it. I am hoping that you would allow me to continue it online instead.\\nThe course started on January 2nd, 2025 and the class is scheduled for every other day from 7:00 pm to 9:00 pm which is intended for employees like me. I joined the lectures for the first two weeks without any problem. However, I have recently been assigned to some new tasks in my office and I cannot leave my desk before 7:30 pm. Hence, I cannot continue this course as the timing contradicts my office hours.\\nAs a solution and since I really want to complete this course, I would request you to let me continue it online. I have already talked to Mr Leonardo, the admin manager, and he recommended me the online course. If you permit me to continue it online, I will be able to watch the recorded lectures and attend the final exam at the end of this course.\\nThanks in advance for your cooperation. I am looking forward to hearing from you soon.\\nYours sincerely,\\nSiamak Mirzaei\\n[", "Dear Mr Smith,\\nI trust you are doing great. I would like to inform you that I am unable to continue your evening lectures on the computer networking course due to the recent responsibilities in my office. As an IT officer in a bank, I find this course enormously important and relevant to my profession. I am hoping that you would allow me to take the online course instead.\\nMy bank is going to open two new branches in Chittagong and I have to stay there for approximately 3 to 4 months to manage the branding, advertising and operational activities. In that case, I am afraid I am unable to attend your lectures.\\nHence, it is my humble request to you to transfer my course from classroom lectures type to online lectures. This would enable me to finish the course wherever I stay for my professional needs. I would be much obliged for your cooperation in this matter.\\nI am looking forward to receiving your positive response soon.\\nYours sincerely,\\nShadia Rahman\\n["]'::jsonb,
