  E'["Dear Mr. Thompson,\\nMy name is Ella Young, and my family and I have been renting your Maple Street apartment for the past six months. I am writing to bring to your attention some issues with the furniture on the property that require urgent attention.\\nThe main concern is the dining table and chairs, which are quite unstable. The table legs are wobbly, and one of the chairs has already broken while in use. Additionally, the sofa in the living room is in poor condition, with torn fabric and sagging cushions, making it uncomfortable to sit on. We also noticed that one of the wardrobe doors in the master bedroom does not close properly.\\nGiven these issues, I would appreciate it if you could either arrange for repairs or consider replacing the damaged furniture at your earliest convenience. Please let me know how you would like to proceed.\\nI look forward to your prompt response.\\nYours sincerely,\\nElla Young", "Dear Ms Linda,\\nI am a tenant in one of your properties in William Street, Norwood. I am writing this letter to bring your attention to some of the substandard furniture that you have provided as part of our rental agreement. I am hoping that you would either fix them or replace them with new ones.\\nIn relation to the specifics, I live in apartment 17B with my family for the last 4 months. We were excited when we moved into this apartment but disappointed when we found that a couple of furniture and appliances were old and torn down. The sofa set in the living room has the worst condition. The colour of the cushion has faded out and they are not usable. The coffee table has a broken leg. Besides, the refrigerator in the kitchen does not maintain the desired temperature accurately and the grocery cupboard door locks are missing. Overall, some of the furniture and stuff you have provided are in faulty conditions.\\nI request you to look into this matter urgently. I recommend you kindly arrange for the repair and maintenance of the living room furniture and replace the fridge. New keys for the cupboard can be prepared by a locksmith. I expect your action on this as soon as possible, as these problems are affecting our living and well-being.\\nYours Sincerely,\\nRamesh Roy\\n[", "Dear Mr Jones,\\nI am Elissa Gomez, a tenant at your apartment on Lakeshire avenue, writing to inform you about the poor condition of a few pieces of furniture that require immediate fixing.\\nI, along with my husband and two young children, moved to your flat 3B last June, and I signed the rental agreement a week later. I have been living in this apartment for the last four months, and I like living here with my family. However, the dining table and the sofa set require immediate fixing as they are now a matter of concern for our peaceful living in this furnished apartment that we otherwise love so much.\\nThe problem with the dining table is that it has uneven legs and two broken chairs. Besides, the sofa set is also very old and the cover needs to be replaced immediately. When I first pointed those issues to you before moving into the apartment, you agreed to fix them by purchasing two new chairs and new covers for the sofa set while also calling a carpenter to work on these two pieces of furniture. However, nothing has been done so far! I would really appreciate it if you resolve it as early as possible.\\nPerhaps you can repair the uneven table and replace the sofa cover first and then fix the other issues a few days later. I believe this would solve the matter without costing you much while also allowing me to live placidly in your apartment.\\nI wish to hear a positive reply from you soon.\\nYours sincerely,\\nElissa Gomez", "Dear Ms Saradha,\\nHope you are doing great. I am a new tenant in your apartment 106-C, writing in connection with the defective condition of some of the furniture in my apartment. I am hoping that you would arrange to replace them soon.\\nIn relation to the specifics of the faulty furniture, the legs of the dining table are uneven and it makes the table unusable. Besides, two chairs are missing. On top of that, the sofa set in the living room is old and substandard. It needs to be replaced immediately.\\nWhile I signed the rental contract, you assured me to have these pieces of furniture replaced. Two months have already elapsed but nothing has been done. Imagine how awful it is that we can not enjoy our dinner together and cannot seat in the living room!\\nIt would be highly appreciated if you could kindly find a replacement for this furniture soon and make our living comfortable.\\nI am looking forward to hearing from you soon.\\nYours sincerely,\\nPriya Nivetha\\n["]'::jsonb,
