  E'["Dear Niro,\\nHope you''re in good health and spirit. I felt so happy to receive your letter last week. Anyway, you''ll be glad to know that I''ve bought a nice gift, actually, a wristwatch for you when I went to visit Switzerland about a couple of weeks ago.\\nI know how you''ve always loved to wear a wristwatch, especially one from Europe. So I''ve bought one for you, which is gorgeous and classy in my taste. Housed in a beautiful platinum case, this watch has a shiny, dark silver colour strap. Besides, its crystal perfectly matches with its hour markers inside which illuminate nicely in the dark. It is made by \\"Tissot\\", one of the renowned watch brands in Switzerland.\\nI chose this gift because not only it''ll look good on you, but also because it won’t get damaged quickly due to excessive sweating, especially, when I know how profusely you sweat during the summer. I also thought it would be a good gift from my tour for you.\\nI think I''m going to mail this watch in a courier service which should be delivered to you in the next couple of days. Please let me know whether I should courier to your home or office address.\\nTake care and stay fine.\\nWarm wishes,\\nMartin\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 3.73 (26 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nGT Writing Task 1\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\nAksat Parekh\\n4 years 7 months\\nYou have recently purchased a gift item for one of your friends.\\nWrite a letter to this friend.

I hope you are in good health. I am so glad that your birthday is just around the corner - it''s just 14 days from now. So, I have picked a special gift item for you.\\nI have bought a ''One Plus Nord'' smartphone for you on occasion on your birthday. The phone has a 64-megapixel camera, 6 gigabytes RAM, 128 gigabytes storage and a stunning 5.6\\" retina screen.\\nEarlier, I had a plan to visit your place in person and surprise you with the gift; however, it won''t be possible now to get a two-day holiday because of a project deadline. So I will miss your birthday party which I already regret. So, instead of sending the present simply by courier, I have requested the company outlet in Rajkot district to call you at the store and hand you over the phone. They have suggested my virtual presence over a video call to witness your expressions about the gift.\\nPreviously, I was planning to give you a laptop computer as your birthday present but discarded the idea since your company has recently given you a brand new laptop. So, I changed my plan and thought to present you with a One Plus phone knowing how much you love this smartphone model. I hope you will like the gift.\\nWarm wishes,\\nAksat Parekh\\nReply\\nQuote\\nTatag\\n4 years 10 months\\nDear Kate,\\nHope you''re doing excellent. I felt so happy to receive your letter last week. Anyways, you''ll be surprised to know that I''ve bought a special gift, a diamond choker, for you when I went to visit Dubai about a couple of weeks ago.\\nI know you have always wished to wear a choker, especially one from Dubai. So I''ve purchased it for you, which is gorgeous and classy in my taste. Every diamond in it is manually equipped in the laces. Additionally, you won''t believe that on a special offer, we have received a couple of gold wedding rings with our original purchase.\\nI believe this would be a special gift for you because you always wanted and then discarded buying such a diamond choker many times because of other commitments in your life. This is just a small token of appreciation for the many things you have done for me. Also, you always insist and tell me to opt for the diamond certificate, so I have both the certificate and receipt.\\nI wanted to send this gift to you as soon as possible to see your excitement, however, it is way more expensive to send via a courier. Thus, I am planning to come and give you it on your birthday next month.\\nI am looking forward to meeting you and celebrate your birthday next month.\\nTake care and stay safe.\\nWarm wishes,\\nRob\\nReply\\nQuote\\n×\\nReport\\nReport\\nClose"]'::jsonb,
