  E'["Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI am writing to book your restaurant for a graduation party we are going to celebrate on 27th August. I, along with my family, have visited your restaurant several times and would like to organise the party in your restaurant. I am hoping to get further information and a confirmation of the availability of your party hall on that day.\\nDelicious food, ambient environment and the behaviour of your waiters were very impressive so far. So, when we were planning to organise a party, your service came to my mind first and I have decided to book it. This would be a graduation party for around 25 students and we will enjoy every bit of it. I am sure you have already arranged other graduation parties and know well about the nature of this sort of party including noise, gathering and need for quick service.\\nAs I have already mentioned, the program will be held on 27th August. Some friends might use drinks for them and I hope you can arrange it. We need the hall room from 6:00 pm to 9:30 pm. Please inform me about your menu for dinner as well as the projected cost to serve the party at your restaurant. I also hope to get a discount as a regular customer.\\nI will be waiting for your response.\\nYours faithfully,\\nSudip Pant", "Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI am writing to reserve the party hall at your restaurant - California Inn in North Street, London, on the evening of 14th November. I have recently graduated from Loyola High School and intend to book your place for a graduation party we are planning to organise. I am hoping that you would provide me with some details and help me book the hall.\\nThe graduation party, as the name implies, is meant for the mushrooming young minds passing out of our high schools this year. As a new graduate and the organizer of the function, I need to make sure the party goes well. As of now, we are flexible with the date as per the availability of the restaurant but would insist on dates from 22nd to 25th of this month. We plan an overnight party starting from 20.00 hrs to 5.00 hrs the next day.\\nNow, I reckon it is imperative to mention that our high school is multicultural in nature and hence a streamlining on the food menu would be impossible. As the convener, I would suggest you include food items like pasta, rice, roasted chicken, burgers, mutton and sandwiches which are globally well accorded. Please note that a few vegetarians would be among us, so I would also request something special, from your end to their delight.\\nWe will be around fifty people all together and hope to enjoy a memorable event held with high regard at your restaurant. Finally, let me know the approximate cost and availability of your establishment as early as possible.\\nIn anticipation of a prompt reply to facilitate further.\\nYours faithfully,\\nAlfred Jones\\n["]'::jsonb,
