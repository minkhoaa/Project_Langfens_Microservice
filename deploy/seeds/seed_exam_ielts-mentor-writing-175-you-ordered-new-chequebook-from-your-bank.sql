  E'["Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI am writing to complain about the poor customer service that I have received from your bank lately. Despite giving a chequebook requisition almost fifteen days ago, I am yet to receive it. I have not got a proper response from the branch and I am hoping you would resolve it.\\nTwo weeks ago I ordered a chequebook by filling out the request form when I visited the bank in person. But neither have I got the chequebook nor have received any correspondence from the bank. I urgently need the chequebook as I have a few bills that I need to pay by cheque. I maintain a checking account with your Lockshire branch and my account number is CAA-2547847354.\\nI am requesting a proper explanation for the delay and poor service. Please inform me how much longer I will have to wait for my chequebook. I would also like to know what action you are going to take regarding this bad service.\\nI have been a customer of your bank for more than fifteen years and this is the first time I have had to complain. It is very disappointing.\\nI look forward to hearing from you soon.\\nYours sincerely,\\nRocky Taylor", "Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI ordered a new chequebook for a savings account that I maintain with your bank. It has been more than two weeks and I have not received it yet. I am writing to complain about this bad service and hoping you would rectify that.\\nI have been maintaining the account in your branch for more than a decade and my account number is 7012845181. Generally, the service offered by the bank is praiseworthy, but I cannot say so this time. I placed a chequebook requisition on 14th January and I am still waiting to receive it. I have some payments to make including a payment to my pension fund and I cannot do so without the chequebook.\\nIt usually takes 4-5 working days to receive a new chequebook and I am not sure why it is taking so long this time. More surprisingly, when I called the bank the day before yesterday, I got no reliable response. I, therefore, request you to look into this issue and give me a probable date by which the chequebook would be delivered to my address.\\nFurthermore, I would like to get appraised about the reasonable action that would be initiated from your end so as to reduce the possibility of reoccurrence of such a bad incident in the future.\\nI am looking forward to hearing from you soon.\\nYours faithfully,\\nMehra Niraj", "Dear Sir or Madam,\\nNot sure whether you would exactly like to read this letter, but I am left with no other choice but to take this matter to you.\\nWhen I opened a bank account with your branch about a couple of weeks ago, I was told that I was entitled to receive a new chequebook, free of charge, within the next few days if I had applied for it. So, I filled out the application and submitted it on the same day. But unfortunately, I haven’t received anything as yet. By the way, I have even called your bank about this matter but no definitive answer was provided.\\nTherefore, I would like to ask you how much longer I would need to wait to receive my new chequebook. I would also like to know what actions exactly you are going to take to expedite the process because I am really in need of some money now, and I just don’t see how possibly I could be able to withdraw any money from my bank account without those cheques.\\nI will be waiting for your urgent response.\\nYours faithfully,\\nSonia Mirza\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 4.82 (11 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nGT Writing Task 1\\nFormal Letter\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\n×\\nReport\\nReport\\nClose"]'::jsonb,
