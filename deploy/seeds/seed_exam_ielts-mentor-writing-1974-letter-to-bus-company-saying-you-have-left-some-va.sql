  E'["Dear Sir or Madam,\\nLast Friday, I travelled from Cubao Station to Ayala Bus Bay on one of your buses. Unfortunately, I left a bag on the bus and hoping that you would notify me of the whereabouts of the bag so that I can retrieve it.\\nIn relation to the journey that I made, I embarked on a bus at the Cubao Station (Bus No. CA234) on 17th April 2021, at around 8:00 in the morning, and took off at Ayala Station. I checked in the bag and declared its contents while checking in.\\nWhen I realised that I left my bag after a few hours, I have tried to locate the bus at the Ayala Station, but I failed to do so. It is a medium-size black backpack with white straps and a pouch in the front. It has a panda luggage tag that shows my name and contact details. The bag contains some important documents and a 14-inch black Toshiba laptop with a black leather cover. The content of the bag is really important to me and my work and I need those urgently.\\nIf you have already found it, kindly call me at 743-9223014 or do send an email at\\nThis email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it.\\n. I will arrange a pick up with your company. However, if it is possible to be sent via a courier service, it will be a great help. I am ready to bear the delivery charges.\\nI am looking forward to hearing from you soon. Your help will be highly appreciated.\\nYours faithfully,\\nArlyn Crescini\\n[", "Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI took one of your buses from Dandenong Station to Melbourne City Centre last Monday at around 9.00 am but unfortunately, left my handbag in it. I am hoping that you would locate my bag and let me fetch it from your office in Melbourne.\\nThe bus that I took (number AF45871) last Monday was more than half an hour late. Due to this, the bus was overcrowded than usual. My bag was too heavy to carry and therefore I put it on the top shelf. Regrettably, when I got off the bus, I forgot my bag due to the rush and crowd.\\nThis is a red ladies bag with two handles with a pink colour ribbon in front of it. Some important documents, some cash, a notebook and a USB stick were in it. The contents are really important because they are related to work.\\nTherefore, I would really appreciate your update regarding the whereabouts of this bag. Please do not hesitate to contact me on +02-056745777 or email me at\\nThis email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it.\\n. I will come to your office to pick it personally once you have it.\\nI am looking forward to hearing from you soon.\\nYours faithfully,\\nShanika Shani\\n["]'::jsonb,
