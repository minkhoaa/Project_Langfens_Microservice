  E'["Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI am writing to express my utter satisfaction and admiration regarding the outstanding food and service we have enjoyed in your restaurant, “La-Italiano”, last Sunday. Thank you for making our event special.\\nIt was my friend''s birthday, so we decided to celebrate it at your restaurant. We visited your restaurant on 29th July, at around 7.30 pm, due to its convenient location and a good reputation for delicious food. I am happy that we picked your place.\\nFive of us went to your eatery and we enjoyed a traditional Italian cousin for dinner and a special black forest cake from your restaurant. It really did worth the money we paid because I suppose you have hired the best chef in the town! The service of the waiters was also marvellous. They were truly well-mannered, organised and skilled in serving food. On top of that, the interior design of your place is adequately stunning.\\nWe also realised how preciously you treat your customers when my friend got a chocolate box as a birthday gift on behalf of your restaurant. That truly made our day.\\nI hope the authorities of your restaurant will always ensure this excellent service and food to all its guests.\\nYours faithfully,\\nShadia Rahman\\n[", "Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI am writing this letter to express my appreciation for the outstanding dining experience my friends and I had at ''The Keg Steakhouse & Bar'' in Toronto last Friday evening. We had gathered to celebrate my best friend’s 25th birthday, and your restaurant played a significant role in making the occasion truly memorable.\\nWe went to your eatery at around 6.30 pm last Friday to celebrate my friend John''s birthday. From the moment we arrived, we were warmly welcomed by your staff and guided to a beautifully arranged table. The service was impeccable, with our server being both attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. The highlight of the evening, however, was the food. The prime rib was cooked to perfection, incredibly tender, and bursting with flavour, while the lobster tail was fresh and succulent. The Molten chocolate lava cake we ordered for dessert was the perfect way to end the meal.\\nWe were also impressed by the ambience of the restaurant, which created an elegant yet relaxed atmosphere. Please pass on our gratitude to your team for their hard work and exceptional service.\\nWe look forward to dining at your establishment again soon.\\nYours faithfully,\\nWilliam Scott", "Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI am writing this letter to let you know how pleased I and my friends are after celebrating my friend’s 27th birthday at your restaurant. By the way, we were planning to celebrate my friend’s birthday at another place, but we had to change our plan at the eleventh hour for some reason. But, after coming to your restaurant and seeing how you have flawlessly planned for the birthday, I am so glad that we actually went to your place.\\nAnyway, the seating arrangement for so many guests was just perfect. The foods and desserts were just outstanding as they tasted like they were so fresh and right out of the oven. In fact, I would never forget the chewy taste of those mushrooms which were cooked with Italian pasta. And, as for the services, all of your staff members were courteous and professional, and some of them even went out of their ways to write few poetry lines to cheer up our birthday boy.\\nSo, all in all, we all had a great time at your restaurant, and we sure would like to come back again in future.\\nYours faithfully,\\nJimmy Falcon\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 3.40 (41 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nFormal Letter\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\nHihi\\n4 years 5 months\\nSo good!\\nReply\\nQuote\\nRajbir Sinfh\\n9 years\\nHi, team, I want some tips for reading from your side.
