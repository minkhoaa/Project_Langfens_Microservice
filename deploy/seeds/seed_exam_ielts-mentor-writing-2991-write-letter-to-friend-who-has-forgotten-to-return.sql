I would love to know how you all are doing. Do you still work for Smith & Sons Incorporation? Please write me back when you can spare some time.\\nYesterday I took Martha and Mary to a movie theatre and decided to watch a classic movie. We finally watched ''To Kill A Mockingbird'', and we thoroughly enjoyed it. It was my second time though! That reminded me of a time when we talked about Harper Lee''s deep South parable concerns lawyer Atticus Finch, from the book ''To Kill A Mockingbird'', who was at the centre of our conversations for a whole evening. I really enjoyed the book and lent it to you almost two years ago. I hope you have enjoyed the book as much as I did.\\nThis book is precious to me as my late grandmother once owned it and gave it to me on my graduation day. This copy is from one of the first editions and I would hate to lose it. Besides, it reminds me of my grandmother whom I deeply loved. I hope it would not trouble you to courier this book to my home address at your convenience.\\nI wish you all the best and hope to meet you soon.\\nWarm wishes,\\nPatrick\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 3.88 (21 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nInformal Letter\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\nMega\\n7 years 8 months\\nNice.\\nReply\\nQuote\\n×\\nReport\\nReport\\nClose"]'::jsonb,
