  E'["Dear Grace,\\nThank you for agreeing to house-sit for me. It was a great relief when you agreed to take up the responsibilities. I''d like to thank you for that and inform some of the chores you should take care of.\\nIf you need to contact me for any reason during my holiday in Thailand, please ring my mobile phone.

If you need to reach me for anything while I''m away, just send a message either on WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger. I was told by the resort in which I shall be staying, uninterrupted internet access is available there. My mobile phone, however, will remain switched off. If not, I''ll keep on receiving calls from work which will ultimately defeat the purpose of this getaway.\\nAs for Tommy, the dog, he doesn''t really need much care. Just ensure that he gets three meals a day at 6-8 hour intervals. Also, let him be outside in the evening whenever possible so that he can play with the ball. Also, don''t forget to bathe him preferably every other day so that he doesn''t stink.\\nI know that you''ll not stay at my house full time so there aren''t many chores that you need to do. Some small things like emptying the trash can, cleaning the parking area and watering the plants need to be done regularly.\\nOnce again, I really appreciate the help you are extending to me and hope to return this favour sometime.\\nBest regards,\\nRouhullah", "Dear Benjamin,\\nHope you''re doing great.

I can’t thank you enough for agreeing to take care of my pet \\"Boozo\\" while I am on my trip to Ontario for a week.\\nBuddy! I am confident your stay with Boozo will be amazing and he will not let you face any issues. However, I wanted to make sure you have all the details handy in case of any emergency. I''ll be just a call away. You can reach out to me on my rental mobile which is +1 415 673 1233. Pal, Boozo is a very people-friendly dog but is a little mischievous when it comes to morning walks. He tends to play outside more and wants the owner to keep him outside for hours. So, in that case, you need to push him back to the house. Apart from that, he loves eating Purnia’s dog bones, but please make sure to give him just one each day.\\nMate, I don''t want you to get overwhelmed with the household chores. So, I will take care of all the bills and necessary errands before leaving. But you would have to wash the pet bedsheets once and please make sure to place the bins outside around 7 a.m. on Tuesday as that is the Garbage and Organic collection day.\\nOnce again, I want to thank you for taking care of my dog during my trip.\\nLooking forward to meeting you once I am back.\\nLove,\\nSean\\nReply\\nQuote\\nManmeet\\n2 years 7 months\\nDear Cathy,\\nThank you for agreeing to house-sit for me and take care of my dog when I''ll be leaving for my vacation.

Consider rewording the sentence if your readers are likely to object.\\nAlthough some readers still believe it, the rule that prohibits ending a sentence with a preposition is a myth. When the preposition is redundant, though, you should leave it out. If your readers are likely to believe that ending a sentence with a preposition is always an error, consider rephrasing to avoid it.\\nReply\\nQuote\\nGraciela\\n6 years 8 months\\nHello!

Also, make sure you bath the dog every other day and take him out for a walk in the garden.\\nPlease water the plants in the patio and check the letterbox every morning.

It should be more than enough for one week. He is trained to do his elimination on the backyard so you don''t need to worry about cleaning his mess, though he, sometimes, eat quite messily, as most of the cats do. So just sweep the debris off the floor once he''s done eating.Regarding the house- I just expect you to make sure to keep it locked and all electric items disconnected after you''re finished for the day. It would be wise to leave a light on, in the living room and the front yard, just in case. Also, I have a mini garden in the front yard that would need to be watered at least twice a day.I will leave a note on top of my dining table containing my contact number at home, in case you are not able to contact me via my email address, which is xoxo@gmail.com. Please do not hesitate to call me if you have any questions or clarifications.With appreciation,Li an.\\nReply\\nQuote\\nAyodele\\n8 years 9 months\\nVery good.\\nReply\\nQuote\\nSalman Butt\\n9 years 8 months\\nHello, this is indeed a great platform for IELTS preparation and the solution material that is a really great help.
