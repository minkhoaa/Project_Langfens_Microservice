  E'["Dear Mr Carter,\\nI am writing to kindly inform you that, unfortunately, I am unable to continue the Business Management evening course that I have been attending at Greenwood College.\\nAt present, I am working full-time as a marketing coordinator, and although I was initially able to balance my job with the evening classes, my workload has recently increased significantly. My company has assigned me to a new project that requires frequent overtime, making it extremely difficult for me to attend lectures and complete assignments on time.\\nGiven these circumstances, I regret to say that I must withdraw from the course for now. However, I would love to resume my studies in the future. Could you please advise me on the process for deferring my enrolment or possibly joining the course again next semester?\\nI sincerely appreciate your understanding and guidance on this matter. I hope to continue learning under your instruction at a later time.\\nYours sincerely,\\nNathan Campbell", "Dear Mr Kaine,\\nI am a student of the Microsoft Office Training (MST20) course in your institution. I am writing this letter to inform you that I would not be able to attend classes from 20th June onwards. I am hoping that you would allow me to continue the course with the next intake from October 2026.\\nI work with a telecom company as an assistant researcher and due to some recently assigned projects, my office demands more of my time. Besides, I have some strict deadlines ahead and to meet them, I will need to work a few extra hours each day. Also, I will travel to Australia at the beginning of July for some official tasks. All these new responsibilities in my office force me to pause my course for the time being. However, I am willing to complete my course as it would be highly beneficial for my career.\\nTherefore I humbly request you to allow me to attend the next available batch. This would be helpful for me to manage my office work on the one hand and continue my course on the other hand.\\nI look forward to hearing from you soon.\\nYours sincerely,\\nNamrata Jain\\n[", "Dear Mrs Rachel,\\nHope you are doing well. I am Raul Mitra, one of the students who are taking a part-time Oracle Database course with you. Anyway, the reason I am writing this letter is to inform you that I will not be able to continue this part-time course, which I really enjoy with you, for a couple of reasons.\\nThe first reason is that I have been handed a few additional responsibilities at my full-time job which means that I would need to spend extra time at my office. And, if I spend additional time at my office, it is highly unlikely that I will be able to arrive at your class on time. The second reason, of course, is that after finishing my office work, when I actually arrive in your classroom, I feel a bit too tired because of spending too much time on the road due to the bad traffic situation.\\nTherefore, based on my situation above, I would really appreciate it if you could allow me to take the course at another time when it is convenient for me, possibly from the June session.\\nI would really appreciate your help regarding this.\\nYours faithfully,\\nRaul Mitra\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 4.50 (11 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nGT Writing Task 1\\nSemi-formal Letter\\nLetter Writing Sample\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\nParul Jagota\\n4 years 3 months\\nDear Mr. Jenkins,\\nHopefully, this letter will find you and your family in good health. I am writing today to inform you that I will not be able to attend the evening language course. It is becoming increasingly difficult for me to balance my full-time job along with the course, even though I am really enjoying learning from you.\\nNot only do I have to manage the responsibilitie s of a full-time job, but also take care of a kid at home. My husband is mostly travelling for work and is unavailable to take care of our daughter in my absence. Moreover, recently I was assigned a new project at work that keeps me occupied the entire day.\\nIn light of the above-mentioned situation, I reached out to the administration, and they mentioned that there is an option to defer the remaining part of the course to a later date by paying a nominal fee. Conspicuously, I have opted for this facility because I am sure about completing the remaining modules.\\nI eagerly look forward to joining you back when the time allows me.\\nYours Sincerely,\\nParul Jagota\\nReply\\nQuote\\nPranama Salinda\\n9 years 2 months\\nLetter Question: You have a full-time job and are also doing a part-time evening course. You now find that you cannot continue the course.Write a letter to the course tutor. In your letter,• Describe the situation.• Explain why you cannot continue at this time.• Say what action you would like to take.Answer:Dear Mr Wimal, I am writing this letter to inform you my issues in attending the evening English lectures. My name is Pranama Salinda and I am following ‘English for Professionals’ English language programme (Student No. EV/165/31), since 22.10.2015. Also, I am working as an engineering assistant in a reputed private consultancy firm and recently my employer has signed my transfer in a construction site in Kurunagala. As you can understand, I will no longer be able to manage my time to visit for evening language programme as my work site is far away from your institution. Also travelling that much each day is going to be quite impossible for me. Therefore, hereby I would like to inform you my reasons for being absent in the evening lectures in the last few days. Nevertheless, I would like to know whether I will be able to join the weekend classes as that would allow me to continue my course. Otherwise, I would like to join the next batch in a temporary shifting. I will be waiting for your favourable response. Please do not hesitate to contact me.Yours sincerely,Prana ma.\\nReply\\nQuote\\n×\\nReport\\nReport\\nClose"]'::jsonb,
