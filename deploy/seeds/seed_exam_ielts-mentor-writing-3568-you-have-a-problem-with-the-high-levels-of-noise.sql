  E'["Dear Mr Oliver,\\nI am writing this letter regarding the incessant noise that comes from the new canteen that has recently opened near my University residence. Although I am delighted that we have this facility that offers tremendous benefits to students, the restaurant remains open up to midnight, and as a result, there is considerable talking, shouting, music, and the loud sound of motorbikes continuing until about 12:30 each night.\\nThis causes me and my neighbours in the residence a serious quandary because at that time we are either trying to sleep, study or complete an assignment. The noise is so deafening that it is quite impossible to sleep. The sound and the commotion disturb us and hamper our sleep at night, making us tired in the mornings or affecting the progress of our studies or assignment. I am sure you will comprehend that this is a very worrying situation for us all.\\nTo prevent further complications, I would like to suggest that the campus authorities restrict the canteen’s opening hours from 10:00 am to 10:00 pm. I propose that we also put up some signs reminding users to be considerate and keep their noise to an absolute minimum. I hope you would take the initiative to implement them to save us from the nuisance.\\nThank you in advance for your attention to this important matter.\\nYours sincerely,\\nRobert Blake\\n[", "Dear Mr Muller,\\nI am Elena Shephard, a resident at the Brookbrain University Residential Area, writing to complain about the unbearable noise and cacophony from a newly opened restaurant. I am hoping that you will intervene to resolve the problem.\\nThe ceaseless noise problem from the newly opened restaurant has become so severe that it is giving us mental trauma. I am very pleased about living in this otherwise great and peaceful residential area, but the high-pitched noise and honks from motor vehicles generated due to the gathering at the restaurant have made the life of the residents extremely difficult.\\nIt has become such a big problem for us because this eatery remains open till 2:00 in the morning starting from 9.00 AM, and it attracts a large number of crowds every hour. The customers bring cars and motorcycles and talk in front of the restaurant. Moreover, the restaurant authority uses loudspeakers to listen to music day and night. It affects our sleep, study and work since we can hardly concentrate or sleep when there is extreme noise around us.\\nTo solve the problem, the campus authority needs to restrict the canteen’s opening and closing hours between 11:00 AM and 9:00 PM. I suppose the restaurant authority should put some signs to request guests not to use any horns, and stop using the loud music altogether. We are hoping that you would make sure these steps are implemented to keep the noise absolute minimum.\\nThank you for your kind attention and initiatives in advance.\\nSincerely yours,\\nElena Shephard\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 4.86 (7 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nGT Writing Task 1\\nComplaints-letter\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\n×\\nReport\\nReport\\nClose"]'::jsonb,
