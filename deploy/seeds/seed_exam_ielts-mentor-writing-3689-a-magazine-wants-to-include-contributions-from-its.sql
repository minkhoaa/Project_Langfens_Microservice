  E'["Dear Sir or Madam,\\nA recent announcement in your magazine for an upcoming article of yours, titled “The book that influenced me most”, has motivated me to write a few words about a book that had influenced my thoughts very significantly. The name of the book is \\"My Journey to a Bigger Journey\\".\\nThe book was about how a person from a very “humble” family background eventually became the president of a country. It was more like a “biography”, and the author, and also the main character in the book, so beautifully wrote about his struggles and life experience before reaching the pinnacle of success. The book also has many motivating stories and pieces of useful advice.\\nUntil I read the book, I had a habit of virtually blaming anything and everything around me for the bad or negative things that were happening to me. As a result of this, I couldn’t really see my own shortcomings or my faults that were hindering my success. But, after reading that book, I finally got a chance to look at myself – my own negative thoughts and behaviour problems that are – and thereby changing my overall outlook on the world and people around me.\\nSo, it was a great book indeed, and if it could change a negative person like me, it sure could change many others as well.\\nI hope you would mention this book in your article.\\nYours faithfully,\\nAnjali Prabhakar", "Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI recently came across your request for readers'' contributions for the article ‘The Book That Influenced Me Most’, and I would love to share my experience with a book that had a profound impact on my life - \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" by Harper Lee.\\nThis novel, set in the American South during the 1930s, follows the story of a young girl named Scout Finch as she navigates issues of racial injustice, morality, and compassion. Through the eyes of Scout, the reader witnesses her father, Atticus Finch, defend an innocent black man falsely accused of a crime. The book powerfully addresses themes of prejudice, empathy, and standing up for what is right.\\nReading this book deeply influenced my perspective on social justice and the importance of treating others with kindness and fairness. It taught me that true courage is not about physical strength but about standing by one’s principles, even in the face of adversity. Since reading it, I have become more conscious of fairness and inclusivity in my daily life.\\nI strongly believe that To Kill a Mockingbird has the power to influence other readers in the same way it influenced me. Its messages remain relevant in today’s world, encouraging people to challenge discrimination and develop empathy for others. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a book that can change their outlook on life.\\nThank you for considering my contribution. I look forward to reading the article.\\nYours faithfully,\\nEdith Redford", "Dear Sir or Madam,\\nI am delighted to notice that your magazine has invited readers to share their thoughts on the book that influenced them the most. For me, that book is ''The Diary of a Young Girl'' by Anne Frank.\\nThis deeply moving diary offers a firsthand account of Anne’s life as a Jewish teenager hiding from the Nazis during World War II. Her reflections on fear, hope, love, and human resilience are profoundly touching. What makes her story even more powerful is her ability to find beauty in small moments despite the horrors surrounding her.\\nReading this book changed my perspective on life. It taught me the importance of gratitude, optimism, and standing up against injustice. Her words, so full of wisdom and maturity beyond her years, made me appreciate the freedoms I often take for granted. I now strive to approach life with more kindness and empathy, inspired by Anne’s unwavering belief in the goodness of people.\\nThis book is not just a historical account; it is a testament to the resilience of the human spirit. It has the power to influence anyone who reads it, regardless of age or background. I strongly believe that if more people read Anne’s diary, the world would be a more compassionate place.\\nThank you for considering my contribution.\\nI hope more readers will discover this remarkable book through your article.\\nYours faithfully,\\nSummer Lancaster\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nRating 3.25 (18 Votes)\\nIELTS Letter Writing\\nGT Writing Task 1\\nFormal Letter\\nLetter Writing Sample\\nPrev\\nNext\\nName\\nPreview\\nSend\\nReset\\nCancel\\nRSS\\n×\\nReport\\nReport\\nClose"]'::jsonb,
