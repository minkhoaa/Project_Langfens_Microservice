You would like to stay in the college Hall of Residence.Write a letter to the college giving your accommodation requirements. You should outline what your room and food needs are and also ask what alternatives are available if they cannot provide what you want.Answer: Dear Sir / Madam,I am writing this letter to inform you that I have decided to stay in the residence provided by the college during my course.I would be grateful if you could provide me with a single room with attached washroom and large windows on the ground or first floor. I would like to stay alone in the room because from my school days I did not share my room with other students. I would require some essential items in my room like a bed, cupboard, table, and chair. Also, if I get the study lamp that will be great. As I am a vegetarian and college hall canteens provide vegetarian food items. So, it will be easy for me to have food in the college mess. If the above arrangement is not available in the college hostel, then I would like to stay as a paying guest with a small family in the UK, and it should be near to the University so that I can easily commute to and from the college.I look forward to hearing from you soon.Kind Regards,Suraj Nathoo\\nReply\\nQuote\\nZahid\\n10 years 4 months\\nDear Sir,I am a student of Dhaka University, Bangladesh. Last month I was being selected to get enroll myself in the course-\\" Technique to Data Collection\\" at your university. I am writing this letter about my accommodation and some other factors there. As a commoner, I prefer to stay at Hall of Residence to avoid any inconvenience related to my accommodation there. I wish to stay with the group of students, as I can get some basic information there. Personally, I have to bear all of my expenses. So it is a matter of my tension. If possible, you can arrange food facility with accommodation. So far I know, food at a restaurant is very costly. Some of my friends there suggest me to stay with a family. They argue that it will reasonably cheap and also enhance my speaking capability to speak English. It is up to you, which option I should prefer. As you know the course is critical, I request you, if possible, arrange my accommodation with the same group of students. Then I will get some basic guidelines. Finally, I request you to provide a city guided map and any publication describing the lifestyles of the inhabitants there. Please let me know the cost mentioning the type of accommodation.I look forward to hearing from you.Sincerely yours,Zahid\\nReply\\nQuote\\n×\\nReport\\nReport\\nClose"]'::jsonb,
